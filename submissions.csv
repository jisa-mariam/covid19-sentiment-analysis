1.       To enhance protection of our school students against the Wuhan coronavirus infection, MOE will be implementing a Leave of Absence (LOA) for students and staff returning from Mainland China. This will apply to all MOE schools, which include MOE Kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, Special Education (SPED) schools, Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). The LOA will be valid for a period of 14 days, starting from the day after arrival in Singapore. The LOA applies to students and staff from polytechnics and ITE who return from Mainland China on 14 January 2020 or later, and students and staff from schools who return from Mainland China on 15 January 2020 or later.
 
2.       MOE had earlier instituted a range of measures including issuance of advisories to remind students and staff to practise good personal hygiene habits and how to stay safe during this period, requiring them to declare their travel history, and advising those who travelled to China to take their temperature regularly for 14 days upon their return. The latest LOA measure allows MOE to better mitigate the potential risks posed by travel in our schools and institutions, while enabling them to continue with their usual learning and other activities. Students on LOA will be supported via a home-based learning plan, which will enable them to continue with their learning.
 
3.       MOE strongly advises students and their families to monitor their health and adopt good personal hygiene habits. Parents should seek immediate medical attention for their children if unwell, and ensure that their children recover fully before they return to school for classes. Schools will also start daily temperature taking exercises from Wednesday, 29 January 2020 when they reopen, and will monitor students and staff for any signs of flu-like symptoms.
 
4.       MOE will continue to work closely with schools and institutions to keep them updated on the latest medical advice and developments of this Wuhan coronavirus infection.

Parents are alarmed as their sons are forced to screen sickly passengers without adequate protection, despite the government's claim that Singapore's health system is well-prepared for the coronavirus outbreak.

The government has claimed that Singapore has been preparing for another outbreak of a similar scale after SARS and has started collaborating with Raffles Medical to conduct health screening. ""I think we are better prepared now"", the prime minister reportedly said, during a WEF meeting.

The administration so far has advised citizens not to procure N95 masks for personal use and refrain from wearing surgical masks in the public if they are healthy, as Singapore masks supply dwindled and prices surged to $2 a piece.

According to an unnamed source, as the ministry is unable to recruit sufficient healthcare assistants, NSFs from the 41th Singapore Artillery Regiment and other units have been compelled to volunteer in enhanced temperature screening operations beginning tonight. Servicemen will be stationed at airport checkpoints and aerobridges to manually record temperatures for passengers from China, particularly those wearing surgical masks. 

Servicemen are expected to escort sickly passengers to quarantine without protective gowns or N95 masks. ""This is the army"", a regular officer said in an internal briefing, ""just lan lan suck thumb. You can disagree, but you cannot disobey. Understand?"" 

The coronavirus from Wuhan, known as 2019-nCov, has infected thousands and spread to dozens of countries. So far it has claimed a hundred lives in China and has no known cure.
More alarmingly, certain number of infected patients are asymptomatic during its incubation period, putting even well-trained healthcare professionals at risk. ""Putting the lives of ill-trained, ill-equipped, non-professional and forcefully conscripted personnel on the line"", critics noted, ""is a breach of every known code in disease control.""

Concerned parents are flocking to call officers about their sons' safety, but the SAF has so far declined to comment, citing that details about military operations are highly restricted.",,"Exclusive: NSF ""volunteered"" to coronavirus exposure",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ev4bfd/exclusive_nsf_volunteered_to_coronavirus_exposure/

I believe life should go on as normal, until more light is shed on the situation, such as more people being infected. The panic and fear that this virus is causing is imo completely unnecessary, and can be dangerous if the virus actually spreads. If one is really paranoid, just avoid crowded areas whenever possible and practice good hygiene, no need to have a heart attack on social media. After all, it's a virus, and I think it's just a flu with a higher mortality rate (correct me if I'm wrong ). A flu can kill too if someone's immune system is too weak.

It is something that we all do worry about. Parents, students, elderly, we're all talking about it. The government has made some measures and introduced some policies like the travel ban to try and contain the virus and limit it's spread.   
However, recently, after reading through some comments on social media platforms of people giving their opinions on the matter and the comments and actions of the ministers, it really saddens me to see so many people criticizing the ministers, especially Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. I know that it is impossible to always get everyone to be supportive of your statements and actions. But this just didn't seem right to me (to me, my personal opinion, take it with a grain of salt). Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong along with some other ministers said that there is no need for Singaporeans to wear masks if they are not sick and it might be even counter productive.   
This comment made many Singaporeans angry and upset that the ministers are not supporting their belief of ""It's better to be safe than sorry"" and their decision to take all precautions when tackling this new virus. I can understand why, I really do. We all have loved ones, we all have friends, we all do not wish to see people that we love and care being in pain and in a life or death situation. No amount of deaths is ever too small. Life is precious.   
But after analyzing the current situation, the ministers are not wrong. The masks are limited and there is a severe shortage of them. (Note: this is a very important point) We do not have many masks to go around, let alone sustain our extreme precautionary measures for long term. And it's not likely we will be getting an abundance of them anytime soon because other nations are also getting stocked up. Facing this virus, we all should take precautions. Wearing a mask is definitely a precaution and it can offer at least a small amount of protection. But, so far there are no confirmed carriers of the virus that are not being quarantined at hospitals. One of the main ways the virus transmits is through contact. If you touch someone or something with the virus and then touch your face, the virus can enter your body through your nose, eyes or mouth. A mask cannot prevent you from contact with the virus, it just simply can't. One way to beat that is just to frequently wash your hands with soap. The other way it is transmitted is through coughs, etc. One extremely popular belief is that the standard face masks (the surgical ones) protect you from the virus. There has been little evidence that supports that claim. The actual purpose of wearing the mask is to prevent the spread of the virus when you are a suspected carrier or when you are sick (to prevent people being paranoid). And this is exactly what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in the interview. The masks should be reserved for those that are unwell and those who are fighting the virus on the front lines (doctors, nurses, etc). The masks that actually ""protect"" you from the virus are the N95 masks, not the surgical ones.   


Since there is a shortage of masks, it is important to use them wisely. Right now, the situation is being handled well, and there is a very low chance you will get infected just by going outside. And if we start using the bulk of our supply right now, it would be catastrophic when there are actually confirmed cases outside hospitals and an outbreak starts in Singapore.   


When the situation worsens, everyone wearing a mask is definitely warranted and I firmly believe that the government would support that. But right now, the chances of infection are still too low for that, and if we run out of masks later on, our own strategy and selfishness to ""protect"" ourselves by wearing masks when there's no need to would become our ultimate downfall.   


Just like this virus situation, we buy a fire extinguisher to keep at home in order to protect us from fires when they start by putting them out. We do not buy fire extinguishers to spray around the house to prevent a fire. Bear in mind, we only have 1 fire extinguisher, and that single fire extinguisher is for us to keep and use when we need it. Don't use it before the house is on fire. Don't waste your masks.   


Stay vigilant, not anxious. Use masks wisely.",,My *personal* opinion on the current situation (Wuhan virus),https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ewqe1i/my_personal_opinion_on_the_current_situation/
ewqx3o,1580488280,ewqx3o,0,,"This just happened, was hilarious and I thought I would share my experience of how the elderly blindly believe the things they see in Whatsapp and Facebook, with all the fake news about wuhan flying around right now.

For some time, my grandparents have been receiving and sharing messages on whatsapp about how to keep the wuhan (or in general, the flu virus) away. My grandma/grandpa received this msg and shared it to our family's whatsapp group.

Quick little translation with my crappy chinese is that basically, onions (with the ends cut off or whatever) can absorb the flu virus and keep you healthy. People who did it never got the flu, doctors found the flu germs on the onions people placed in their rooms, etc.

Had quite a good laugh. Shared it with my friends. Went back home joking to my brother that we should cut an onion and place it in my grandparents' room before they got home to pledge our filial piety.

Man, little did I know we were in for a ride.

Grandparents came home. Grandma starts cutting the ends of onions and placing them in each room. She actually believed that onions can magically detox the air of the flu (and wuhan).

Spent a good 30minutes crying, not sure if it was from the laughter or the raw onion fumes, probably because of the joke my boyfriend made that 'if only the wuhan market sold onions', and am now annoyed as my room stinks with the raw onions.

On a side note, please keep healthy and caution your elders if they start believing fake news on the internet.

TLDR; grandma saw chain msg on whatsapp that onions can keep the wuhan away, placed raw onions around my entire house.",,Grandma actually believes placing onions near you can absorb the flu virus,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ewqx3o/grandma_actually_believes_placing_onions_near_you/

See someone who needs an MRT seat more than you? No, I'll ignore him/her completely.

Someone needs help? Ignored.

Someone from a particular nationality did something wrong? Sterotype their entire race and blame Singapore's problems on them

Foreign immigrants contibuting to our society and filling in the gaps for the sake of our future? Claim that they are stealing our jobs.

Virus strikes? Hoard masks and do not let those who truly need it obtain it, potentially causing further spread of the virus being spread.

Virus gets more serious? Hoard food items and do not allow those who need daily supplies to obtain the food items.

Someone works 24/7 at the front lines, putting themselves at point blank range for YOUR SAKE and SAFETY? Scolds them and asks them to go away.

And the one that makes my blood boil the most:

Got masks? Sell them at a ridiculous price, profiteering off the needy. Profiting off a need. Profiting off something that someone desperately needs. That ridiculous selfishness causes panic and the virus to further spread. Just for a few dollars, you want to put others lives in danger. Scumbags.

“Do not close our borders :( it is xenophobic” To the people who were championing free movement in the name of globalisation/freedom/importance of openess: Would you open your hdb/condo/property to china/wuhan visitors after it is ESTABLISHED that they are coming from the source of the virus?

The lazy ant did not survive the winter. Buying a year worth of groceries is definitely out of whack. But getting some additional supplies for the house? it definitely made sense for this group of Singaporeans. 

Think about this.

“Healthy people dont need to wear mask” To the people pointing out people wearing mask as ignorant/inconsiderate/wasting resources: I only have one request. please dm me and send me your mask that the govt provided. I promise I would return them to you if you fall sick. 

Worst thing we can do in an epidemic? Underestimate it. Being PC/idealistic/carry an holier than thou attitude doesnt stop any virus, at least not in human history so far. Going full out paranoid is not going to help, neither does staying far left on the idealistic path.

&amp;#x200B;

From a national perspective:

\- assumption: NTUC/government still able to continue importing essential items like rice, noodles, toilet paper; they have been able to replenish their warehouses that were drawn down in the past few days

\- assumption: it is unfeasible for NTUC/government to hoard more essential items, due to carrying costs of inventory, and because warehouse space is not unlimited

\- in 2 months, if the global epidemic worsens and other countries stop exporting to us, or we face a shortage - Would our country be better off if we had a combined total 500 tonnes of food or 700 tonnes of food? (the extra 200 tonnes being distributed across Singaporean homes as a result of hoarding)

\- in effect, Singaporeans who have hoarded have offered up their homes as warehouses to increase total available stock of essential items within the borders

\- Note: There is a distribution issue between houses who have hoarded and not, but this does not affect the fundamental truth that the country holds more stock of essential items

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From an individual perspective:

\- ensure that you are realistically able to consume items before expiry; no wastage of food

\- consume foods that will expire soonest

\- hoard items with key considerations: high calorie value, long expiry duration, low space usage, staples or essentials with low likelihood of throwing out

\- wastage is a drain on our country's total stock of food

\- if the country resorts to rationing items, those who have hoarded are more likely to not collect due to inconvenience or not seeing it as as much of a necessity - see mask collection rate. This acts as natural redistribution of items.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why I have not hoarded:

\- heard that the queues are really long

&amp;#x200B;

The recent hoarding was likely caused by paranoia, not out of good intention to hoard more as a nation collective, and not out of rational thinking. Hoarding has bad optics and we might be quick to jump at those who hoard, and the action might also raise panic levels. Yet, it may increase national preparedness in case of future shortages.

f1npgl,1581325056,f1npgl,0,,"I finished A Levels last year and I'm about to get my results in about 2 weeks time. I've been doing as much research as I can online as well as talking to any friends/contacts and I've even registered to go for relevant info sessions to learn more about the courses and scholarships I want to try for.

For Uni courses, I actually really want to do NUS Life Sciences major (spec in biomedicine) and minor in econs or NTU Biological sciences major and minor in econs. I have a lot of interest in biology especially in DNA and illnesses like viruses, cancer etc. I intend to take a minor in econs because of my interest, but I like bio so much more so I wanted to take bio as a major. 

However, based on the research I did (to really the best I could), courses like life sciences/biological sciences are just too academic in nature to be applicable for finding jobs. The job prospects are rather questionable in that sense, and I did consider possible options about studying uni course.

One of the possible jobs I thought of after studying bio is to do PGDE and do teaching. But as I'm currently in my MOE Teaching internship, I've come to realise that my interest is really in learning more about Bio and not necessarily teach bio. So I did cross out teaching off my list.

These are some options I've been thinking. I'd like to have some advice

1. One way I could do it is to take a double major? That way I could have a ""safety net"". Something like doing biomedicine as well as accounting. I'd say my math is pretty decent to be honest, not amazing enough to do math majors but not that bad either. My only issue is that taking a double major could make it very taxing/stressful. It's not that I'm being lazy at all, in fact I'm the total opposite. But all that immense pressure I put on myself for studying for so many years straight has started to affect my mental health a bit. If really possible I'd like to study something I like (Yes I know studying bio includes a lot of content, but because I have a huge interest in it I know that I'll be able to handle it)
2. Take nus life sci as a premed course, and try to apply for postgrad medicine course.  
I figured because I have a huge interest in a lot of illnesses eg viruses, cancer and also because I personally actually crave a social interaction aspect, this could be a possible option. Well the only thing is that I'm aware how super competitive it is. And also I did try to go for job shadowing but unfortunately due to the 2019-nCov virus and for safety reasons, it got cancelled for now. I'm still in the process of trying to get more info for this.
3. Scholarships with bond. I saw the A\* STAR scholarship but it wants 11 AUs pref (I only have 10. Three H2 and one H1 subs)   
I also saw the Biomedicine SgIS Scholarship. There isn't much info online tbh thus I'm intending to go for the info session event that's being held in 2 weeks time (Hopefully doesn't get cancelled because of DORSCON Orange)
4. Don't do bio at all. My parents are particularly traditional Singaporeans with the mindset that I should study something mainstream, be a doc,teacher, lawyer, accountant etc. I honestly hate the idea of conforming to what they want. But I did think that being pragmatic, I should also consider a degree with decent job prospects

Honestly I would really love to talk to anyone who completed NUS Life sciences course and is currently working or pretty much just anyone who has advice about choosing Uni courses. Really appreciate it",,Please advice me on my Uni Dilemma! (NUS Life Sci/ NTU Biological sci),https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f1npgl/please_advice_me_on_my_uni_dilemma_nus_life_sci/

f3s7a3,1581687051,f3s7a3,0,,"That's right, at a time like this, at a time of crisis, it is also the time to support each other and the government. We should be working together to stop the spread of the virus. I get that people are scared and all but we should trust that our government is doing all they possibly can including recently giving us a 5 day MC and contact tracing as quickly as they humanely can. All the measures they are implementing are seriously good compared to other countries who don't give an F.

In fact, I have to say that SOME Singaporeans are NOT doing anything good and in fact deteriorating the situation:
1. When I went to the clinic last 2 weeks ago because I did have a flu (eat too much CNY stuff), I wore a mask there. Yet when I entered the clinic, NOBODY, I REPEAT NOBODY, except the healthcare workers, wore masks. Seriously people. They were sick, like I could see one of the Malay woman shivering (like got fever or smt), yet NONE of them wore masks although govt. ALR tell us to wear masks. -_- 
2. Now that it has gone to orange, we see these type of people again stockpiling food as though our HDB flats are bomb shelters and we're tucking in for WWIII, DESPITE the government reassuring that we have stock. -_-
3. And then you get the ""entrepreneurs"" taking advantage of the situation. -_-

I hope people know that the government are also human. They can't control whether you'll get sick or not, but they can ensure measures and policies that will lessen the chances of you getting sick. 
I'm not a brainwashed government supporter, I agree that they have room for improvement, but I also don't bash the government for every little mistake they do. 
Just think of it from a teacher's perspective, the government will always have room for improvement but based on what they're doing, I can give them at least an A for effort for 1.contact tracing and containing the spread of virus, 2. reassuring Singaporeans that everything will be alright, even going to the extend of visiting possible virus infected places and hence uplifting our morals ... 

Bottom line, NOBODY wanted this virus so EVERYBODY should work together to ensure its extinction instead of pin pointing who to blame.

f7v61w,1582390587,f7v61w,0,,"Hi my name is Andy and i’ve been warning and trying to update people about the coronavirus since January . When the virus was reported as only transmitted through fomites in late January I was already trying to inform my fellow singaporeans that according to China’s Prof Zhong Nan Shan it was transmitted through aerosols . When the experts in Singapore were still debating whether it was human-to-human tranmission i was warning people about the possibility of it being airborne . Whilst many of our mainstream media’s KOL (key opinion leaders) were still quoting WHO stance I was trying to call to attention that western intelligence had already **clearly** ignored whatever WHO’s Director Tedros was saying .

Even until now , i’ve been warning the possibility of reinfections on patients that are discharged and to my greatest horror , I watch as more and more singaporeans  start taking off their masks in accordance with Mr Chan Chun Sing’s advice of not being “idiots” , “xiasuay” or being “disgraceful” . Whilst the rest of the world is starting to see the severity of covid-19 , here we are relaxing our guard and taking off our masks focusing more on washing hands whilst the whole world is starting to believe it is airborne -effectively a major step in the opposite direction in our efforts to protect ourselves , our loved ones and our fellow singaporeans .

On 21  February 2020 , Russia’s MOH shared an official document on their MOH website proving this virus to be man-made . Just like what Guo Wengui (Miles GUO) has been saying , a Chinese billionaire known to be a whistleblower of the CCP for the past three years . 

Everybody should watch his past three days’ broadcasts to keep themselves in the loop of the coronavirus situation.

As Steve Bannon (advisor to Donald j trump) says , this guy has NOT ONCE been proven incorrect in his claims . Not once has he been wrong in his warnings .

I’m only 18 and probably don’t know as much as most of you reading this and in truth not as much as I’d like to know but I’d like to quote Arthur Conan Doyle - once you eliminate the impossible , whatever remains , no matter how improbable , must be the truth .

If everyone faults whistleblowers as traitors , No one would find out truths that the people of authority and power do not want known . There have been many cases where it’s only for the actions of whistleblowers that lives could have been saved . It saddens me to see the Chinese Chamber of Commerce issue a letter voicing their disappointment at the person who leaked the video instead of thinking if there was anything wrong with letting people see this other side of our voted

Representative . I was always taught and often chided that if I had nothing to hide , why be angry if it comes to light ? My Godfather has often taught me that a person of integrity should behave the same whether they’re behind closed doors or in public view . There’re many words that I’ve learnt in my 18 years for people who behave one way in front of some but another way behind those same . Insincere , two-faced and even hypocrites come to mind . If one minute I smile and shake your hand whilst you wear goggles and look silly but the next and more importantly , behind you, I laugh with friends and called you an idiot would most people make me out as being truthful ? My Godfather says if I behave one way in front of people and behave another way behind people I’m a no good two-faced hypocrite and if people found out they’ll never believe me again or will always be thinking what I’ll be saying about them behind their backs . 一切都只是刚刚开始 。 Everything is just beginning . Thank you .

f9c4qw,1582645455,f9c4qw,0,,"**A story:**

On 19 January 2020, a Sunday, Case 83 and Case 91 attended Life Church’s mandarin service at 9am, as was their usual practice. They exchanged greetings and shook hands with the pastor, church staff, and other attendees seated near them, amongst whom were two strangers from China (Case8 and Case9) that they had never met before. 

25 January 2020, 6 days after that church service, it’s the first day of Chinese New Year, Case 83 and Case 91 made their way down to Mei Hwan Drive, an ominous address that Singaporeans will come to find so familiar. It was a CNY gathering of I-still-don’t-know-what-link. Given their age (Case 83 is 54yo), I guess Case 91 is a daughter of Case 68 (79yo female). It’s the first day of CNY after all.

It was a large party, with the usual overflowing buffet of food, and the all important lohei for good luck. Who would want to miss out on the Toto hongbao draw? What a great toss-up it was as to who would receive the fortunes from this lohei, well we have the answers - the winning numbers are 66, 68, 70, 71, 80, additional number 84).

26 January 2020, next morning, second day of CNY, Case 91 apparently is so unwell, and the GPs are mostly closed because it’s CNY, so they head down to Sengkang General Hospital A&amp;E! One wonders how severe her symptoms were, but anyway she gets sent home as it is CNY after all, the hospital staff also want to enjoy their public holiday. She continues to rest at home, or maybe she continued munching on Chinese love letters.

28 January 2020, 9 days after the church service, now Case 83 is also getting unwell. It’s not too bad so he continues to work through the week, only going to the gp on 1 Feb, 5 Feb, 6 Feb. He is puzzled and concerned that he isn’t getting better. MOH is talking about all these Chinese travellers in Singapore. 

Case 66 is also unwell from 29 January (just 4 days after the CNY gathering! He must have had a lot of the lohei droplets) and gone to multiple GPs on 2 Feb, 5 Feb, 12 Feb. Being a young man following the news intently, he is very concerned about his health but he doesn’t have any known risk factors and continues to work diligently at Grace Assembly of God. 

6 Feb 2020 - some locals fall to the virus but the taskforce is doing everything to resist announcing a DORSCON change. Apparently it’s all in the works and the press release is being typed out and approved tonight. 

7 Feb 2020 - the fateful day that MOH announces more unknown community transmissions, raises DORSCON to ORANGE, and all hell breaks loose.

It isn’t until 8 Feb that MOH announces that c8 and c9 - the two tourists, attended Life Church. Oddly neither Case83 nor his doctors seemed to put two and two together, and still sent him home on 10 Feb. When his symptoms still didn’t clear up Eight days later, he went straight to NCID on 18 Feb, forget about those lousy GPs! Frankly, as someone who both had contact with the Life Church cluster, AND contact with case66, his light bulb should really have gone off on 8 Feb with the first news, or if not, then on 14 Feb when Case 66’s entire family was confirmed.

Case 70 (wife? sister?) also falls lightly ill from 3 Feb, subsequently tested and recovered quickly. 

Case 68 (70yo female), the grandmother, starts to feel some symptoms on 30 January (5 days), but doesn’t think much of it as she’s one of them old folks with so many ailments already. She never goes to GP or polyclinic until the entire family is forced to be tested on 14 Feb. 

Case 71 is a friend of c66 who attends the same church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life. 

Case 80 is unclearly linked to c66, no proper details provided by MOH, tsk. Not a direct family member as she stays elsewhere, does not seem to attend the same churches either.

Case 84 is also unclearly linked to c66, maybe another relative. Both c80 and c84 reported symptoms on 4 Feb, 9 days after the CNY gathering?

Case 88 I don’t believe she contracted the illness during the gathering as she fell ill on 16 Feb (21 days after the gathering date), most likely a subsequent contact of c66, who is surprisingly virulent or touchy.

**Additional points to note**

\- The above is partly in jest and partly to try to make sense of what actually happened, rather than the confusing and sterile MOH press releases which provide lots of unhelpful distracting data and missing lots of details. I do not claim any of it to be true, please don't take this as the truth at all! Any resemblance to the truth is totally coincidental (other than official MOH press release info), and I do not know any of these people.

\- While credit to the Contact Tracing team(s) for identifying Case 91, Case 83 attended the same events as Case 91 - the Life Church service and the CNY gathering. Case 83 was also also active Confirmed. Hence this highly possible link ought to and probably was picked up earlier. 

My guess is that that when Case 83 was announced last week, the authorities saw the contact tracing link almost right away between Case 83 and Case 66. However, 83 was not yet symptomatic on 25 Jan (CNY), he only developed symptoms (supposedly) on 28 Jan. The authorities did not want to link them as it would suggest asymptomatic transmission, and all hell would break loose if this is claimed. 

After an extra weekend of investigation, they managed to pry out the truth that Case 91 (wife) was also ill, earlier than Case 83, and the dates now match up well. If SG had announced this last week, it would be like the German case where they first thought the Chinese visitor transmitted asymptomatically but later found out she was actually unwell, just that nobody asked her. Points to the level headed Singapore investigators.

Case 91 is the icing on the cake where it was an additional back-confirmatory case where MOH could show off their serological testing. 

\- I tried my best to check the information, but there are a large number of cases and I've been at work the whole day so I'm a little tired. Also details are sometimes spread out over different press releases.

\- I am sure the Contact Tracing and Police teams have access to way more information

\- I also want to urge everyone to promptly and intelligently report any possible links you might have to your GP or doctor if you are ill or suspect you might be ill. It would greatly help everyone. 

\- And of course, best wishes and speedy recovery to those still in hospital.",,A (half fictional) story inspired by MOH Press Release of 25 Feb 2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f9c4qw/a_half_fictional_story_inspired_by_moh_press/

Hey Reddit,

This recent coronavirus issue has led to shortages of many protective items such as masks, sanitizers, etc in popular stores, mostly exacerbated by unnecessary hoarding. As a result, people who need the items are unable to get them. Eg, ([https://mustsharenews.com/diabetic-man-alcohol-swabs/](https://mustsharenews.com/diabetic-man-alcohol-swabs/))  Stores aren't stocked equally, and it's difficult for one person to know which stores have stock of what items.

I wanted to do something to help this situation, and inspired by that post + Govtech's [maskgowhere.sg](https://maskgowhere.sg), I created MaskGoHere to try to alleviate this problem.

MaskGoHere is a crowd-sourced map showing the stock of certain items across various stores in Singapore, a map powered by Singaporeans, for Singaporeans. Anyone can contribute stock updates via Telegram or even new stores (as some mama shops or smaller independent stores still have stock of these items!)  and it'll be reflected in the map instantly. At one glance, you can filter for available items across Singapore.

**Wait but that's stupid, how do you expect this to work with Singaporeans being kiasi etc etc &lt;insert generic comment about selfish nature&gt;**

You're not wrong, and that was on my mind while building this. [But I choose to believe in the good nature and compassion that we have](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-unite-5-acts-of-kindness-that-prove-the-kampung-spirit-is-alive-and-well) and am willing to take the risk. In this trying time, I'm chancing that we can band together to help one another instead. 

DISCLAIMERS (Cause no good deed goes unpunished)  
1. I'm doing this completely in my own capacity, not based on my employer etc.  
2. I'm not getting paid for this, all server costs etc are paid by my own pocket.  
3. If people abuse this (which is a very realistic possibility) I will take it down.

My father returned from Shanghai following a bereavement trip and was issued a 14 days Stay Home Notice. It has been 1 week and he has been complying with the notice. What bothers me is his total lack of consideration and his attitude towards this whole covid-19 situation. On the 1st meal together, when my mother tried to get him to separate the food, he got angry. On our 2nd meal, I said we should use a serving spoon. He reluctantly complied. From the 3rd meal onwards, we shared crockery during meals and we eat from the same plates.  I felt uncomfortable but recalling how my father got angry during the 1st meal, I kept quiet. Seeing how my mother didn't bother as well, I can't help but feel disappointed. Today during lunch , I said that the SHN from MOH mentions we should avoid sharing utensils, to which my father replied (paraphrased): ""covid-19 is not that serious. Sure, transmission rate is higher than your average flu but only the immuno-compromised are at a real risk. So we should not worry about it."" 

I said that if he has the virus, my mother and I would long have gotten it from him. (Given his reluctance/resistance to separate food, and him sneezing/coughing without covering his mouth during the 1 week he has been home) His reply: ""Yea lor exactly"" (trying to justify his whole high-transmission-low-serverity thing)

Sure, he may not have the virus, but who is to say with 100% certainty? So what if he is 99% sure? How is he going to answer if the 1% happens? And what if the virus is (touch wood) deadly for himself or my mother (both age 50+)?",,My father (50+) came back from China,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fc7rix/my_father_50_came_back_from_china/

First off, the company name and license aren't even listed. It's already very sketchy. Even if you asked, they'd ask you to ""come down and find out"".

To save you the time and effort, it's most likely an MLM company that sells water filtration and some magnetic mattress. They spend 10 minutes on the product and the rest of 1 and a half hour telling you about the incentives and selling you a pipe dream. 

Multilevel marketing (MLM) is a strategy some companies use to encourage existing distributors to recruit new distributors who are paid a percentage of their recruits' sales. The recruits are the distributor's ""downline."" Distributors also make money through direct sales of products to customers.

They'd tell you they are an MLM, but are legal, certified under MTI and unlike a pyramid scheme, they are doing direct sales. However the way they are running it is sketchy and dubious. Plus their products are not backed up scientifically.

fg9b7q,1583820315,fg9b7q,0,,"SINGAPORE - On top of washing their hands and disinfecting surfaces, people need to switch off the air-conditioner, turn on the fan and get fresh air to reduce the chances of getting infected by the novel coronavirus.

The reason is that while many unknowns remain about the virus, earlier studies have shown that viruses thrive better in cool, dry climates.

That would make tropical Singapore, with its hot and tropical weather, less conducive for the virus to thrive.

This ""good news"" for Singapore was delivered on Monday (Feb 10) by the Ministry of Health's (MOH) chief health scientist, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, at a press conference.

""The likelihood of viral persistence outdoors is lower,"" he said, as he noted the prevalent use of air-conditioning in Singapore.

Prof Tan was one of eight infectious disease experts in Singapore present at the press conference to brief the media on what is being done to fight the virus, or 2019-nCoV, on both the science and health fronts.

He said plenty of research had been done into how long viruses persist on surfaces following the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003.

""Most of the studies indicate they don't persist well in hot, humid environments,"" he added. ""Hot and humid meaning over 30 deg C, and with humidity levels of over 80 per cent.""

The virus that caused Sars is in the same family as the coronavirus which originated in Wuhan and has spread globally.


The virus is spreading in Singapore, with 45 cases so far. 

Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School, said: ""Air-conditioning is something that can't be helped in Singapore, especially during the hot months.

""But enclosed spaces, where it is less humid and cooler, could help to spread respiratory diseases.""

Experts suggest that another way to reduce the spread of diseases is to keep windows and doors open to ventilate the rooms.

The World Health Organisation, in a document outlining how to prevent the coronavirus from infecting people, said suspected cases should be kept in well-ventilated rooms.

Professor Wang Linfa, director for the programme in emerging infectious diseases at the Duke-NUS Medical School, said ultra-violet rays and heat from the sun could kill the virus.

""If you can stay under the sun for a while, it would be good,"" he added. ""Vitamin D can also boost the immune system.""

Disinfecting surfaces could also prevent the virus from infecting people.

Public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT had said last month (Jan 30) that they are stepping up cleaning efforts for their premises and vehicles.

The Health Ministry has said that for the general public, the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport and in public places, is assessed to be low.",,"Coronavirus: Turn off air-conditioners and open windows to reduce risk of being infected, say experts",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fg9b7q/coronavirus_turn_off_airconditioners_and_open/

They spend large amounts of the day within the unknown ( public transport ,eating,etc) and then come together to fraternize with one another in large herss. Nothing stops them from spreading it to the vulnerable people in their households. We all know kids got terrible hygience and that measures arent being enforced ( kids lie about their temp etc, plan events in secret). The previous govt argument of keeping schools open to track them makes absolutely no sense as otherwise they would  be at home with no unwanted contact!  From what it seems , The ministers are basically admitting they dont have enough data to make an informed decision , so , instead, they do nothing ? Time is now to act. It worked for china. U cant just pick policies based on convinience - everything has to be done. That is our only chance. Why not use online school? From what i see ,  most parents are for closure. Some , however, are scared to voice this opinion due to the loud voices of those without children and scared of any economic impact. The economy will get affected. No one wants it, but alas. For now , let us maintain the health of the general public. Government must be urged to make the right policies. My only concern is that parwnts in health care will be affected; maybe govt can provide some day care services?

To contribute to the fight against Covid-19, I have created a small self-assessment questionnaire, packed with links to official information, to help fellow Singaporeans in the decision making process on whether they should go out or stay at home. 

It took me about 2-days to whip out this little application. Most of the effort were put into writing the advisory content for different scenarios. If this found to be useful, I intend to continue maintaining and add more features to it.

fmsx0q,1584846908,fmsx0q,0,,"What would be acceptable triage guidelines, to you, if Singapore gets overwhelmed by COVID-19? 

In parts of Italy, for example, 'greater life expectancy' is prioritized \[1\], and almost no patients above 70 years old are accepted into the ICU \[2\]. The lack of ICU facilities means that older patients are isolated, and they either fight off the disease with limited help, or die alone \[2\]. 

Singapore's new cases have been growing at 30 to 40 cases a day. On MOH's chart \[3\], it looks like the start of an exponential growth phase, but we can't be sure yet.

To avoid overwhelming Singapore's hospital capacity, we'll all need to reduce physical contact -- and in densely populated Singapore, this translates to staying home more. But I'm not particularly hopeful about this (two days ago, I overheard a guy who recently arrived from Vietnam making light of their lockdown measures; yesterday, I overheard a group of girls being really gung-ho about going on a 'third round' of shopping and it was barely noon; all participants of the conversations sound Singaporean). I'm a bit more hopeful that we can quickly convert normal wards to ICU wards; an Italian hospital administration managed to do so within a day, with the help of engineers \[1\]. 

But worse case scenario, when we have to triage... Do Italy's guidelines (among the critically ill, prioritize the young over the old) sit well with you?

I can imagine alternative guidelines, e.g. set up a social credit scoring system, and de-priortize those who refused to comply with SHN's, or did not attempt any sort of physical distancing. 

Lastly... a big thank you to our healthcare staff, and anyone involved in keeping us healthy and fed :)

My name is Johnathan, I'm reaching out on behalf of a team of analysts advising health organizations and agencies in their fight against Covid-19. Our objective is to gather data and information on how different countries deal with and fight the pandemic - and through that hopefully advise others how they can better fight Covid-19. Since Singapore is relatively dealing well with the current outbreak, we are eager to learn from you.

**We would like to ask for your help with recommendations for sources, experts and/or websites that we could learn from about Covid-19 in Singapore.**

**Also, we would like to hear from you and from your personal knowledge**, every little piece of information can help:

* **Public space** \- Are you allowed outside? must you wear masks or gloves if so? Is there still public transportation? Are there public disinfection sites outside? Does the government disinfect public places?  
* **Getting checked** \- How are people being checked for the virus? What technology is being used to check? Where do people go to, to get checked? How do you decide who needs to get checked?  
* **Using quarantine** \- What steps were taken and when? Who is placed under quarantine? Who still can go to work? How is the quarantine enforced? Are people under surveillance? 
* **Learning from the past** \- What did you learn from SARS? How were you better prepared for Covid-19? Do you have special ""National alertness"" stages? what do they mean?
* **Medical personnel** \- How are medical personnel and their families are being kept safe?
* **Contact tracing** \- How is ""contact tracing"" done? How do you trace the paths of people who became sick and might have contaminated others?

That's it for now - If you are able to help us with these questions, if you know some sources or websites where we can find data and information, or know someone who is an expert in the field and is willing to help - we would appreciate it greatly.

We wish everyone good health,

 Johnathan.",,"Help fight Covid-19 | Learning from Singapore's way of fighting the pandemic, so others can better fight the virus",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/foo3gi/help_fight_covid19_learning_from_singapores_way/

Vaccine:

The path of vaccine is long drawn and often new formulations have to be made, tested on animals, carry mass productions and effectively vaccinate a huge population. This has never ever been done in a short period of time. Small pox took several decades to be eradicated and so is Polio, even after effective vaccines were developed.

Importantly, there is no effective vaccine for caronaviruses (influenza, SARS or MERS). All the previous efforts did not result in an effective vaccine.

Even Dengue, which has been an epidemic for a long time, has no effective vaccine.

Although, the recent advances might result in a vaccine for Covid-19, the world as a whole could not stop a second phase of infections before something is available. So, pining hopes on a vaccine is possibly overrated.

Virus mutations and natural selection

This is the scenario that is likely to be played out in this pandemic.

Virus mutates by genetic shift and drift mechanisms, as it transfers from one host to another.  In this process, virus mutates to from a slightly different strain. In the natural evolution of this process, only the strongest or the one which is in abundance survives. This process always results in a less deadly strain (mutation) to survive.  Every other virus has lost its effectiveness over time in the history of mankind. Unfortunately, it takes 2-3 years.

The reasoning for less effective virus over time is simple.

People with deadly virus strain -&gt; confined or hospitalized -&gt; can not spread the disease much.

People with mild symptoms -&gt; go out and spread -&gt; the virus by natural selection of evolution turns the virus into a milder strain.

Although asymptomatic people do spread, the spread rates increases only with the onset of symptoms (think of someone talking vs someone coughing). Spanish flu if it infects now causes a mild fever and cold {much less lethal in 2 years after it's first pandemic). There are enough studies to indicate that HIV is turning less deadly with the time. This is the promising natural process and one on which I pin my hopes.

fs6xs4,1585631466,fs6xs4,0,,"IDK if it's the WFH blues or whatever but over lunch my dear talk cock friend shared me with an idea that was so elaborate and detailed I thought I might share with you guys.

We were talking about COVID and how there might be a Tekong cluster, and we both agreed that NSFs are essential services and should still be processed. But he brought up the issue about how underpaid they are. (We are both late 20's by the way)

I asked him — how do you propose we find the funds to pay them? This was when his boner stuck up.

He told me about this idea of a ""woman's tax"". For two years, female wages will be ""garnished"" and the money will be put into a centralised pot. The pot will then be used to bump up NSF's wages to a somewhat respectable amount in the ballpark of $1000, which isn't unreasonable if a women contributes around $300 a month, or less if the garnishing period is over three years instead.

This period, he told me, should ""probably start when they get their first full time job but that seems too easy to rig so IDK"". He added that maybe a fixed amount of contributions might make things easier.

He went on to discuss the numbers and how different income levels will contribute different sums, but it's quite boring and I don't remember the specific digits so I won't go into detail.

But he continued, after a prompt, to tell me that the ""pot"" idea was significant as it could help with population fluctuations, which mean that if there were less men that year, there'll be leftover money in the pot for when there were more men.

When there is too much money in the pot, we can have a ""GST Voucher"" for men.

As a joke, I told him, ""But women serve NS through childbirth"". This was when he went galactic brain on me.

""If a woman is pregnant, it means she is married right? The extra money her husband gets will be hers anyway so it's all fair.""

This honestly sounds so retarded but the way he put it across was so convincing I was curious to see if any of you have any criticisms I can pass along to him.

Surely, there must be a major flaw somewhere here.",,Introducing a Women's Text — A Crazy Idea From My Friend,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fs6xs4/introducing_a_womens_text_a_crazy_idea_from_my/

Looking at our DORSCON system, there seems to be insufficient information on the exact practices for each system, and contingency plans.

For example, if you look at the pdf attached in the link, we are more or less practising Red measures while still in Orange.

To be honest, social distancing should be in Yellow or Orange, just to varying degrees. For example, the Red category should be on the level of lockdown, instead of social distancing, which is crucial in stemming local cases and unlinked cases.

People do stuffs like that because they are panic and felt vulnerable under the virus. They cannot control a lot and choose to do a lot of preparation to at least make themselves feel better. This happens in every country and every race. We could see this in China, Hong Kong, Italy, USA, etc, and people from all walks of life would do so to make them feel safe. It is not the matter of stupidity imo. No race is more superior than the other in this sense.

fvcsze,1586088408,fvcsze,0,,"What is the law for? What is the Police and Town council for?

There has been a group of men who have been gathering at the coffeeshop below my house for more than 6 months now. They meet from the afternoon all the way until 2am 3 to 4 times a week. They gather in large groups, make a lot of noise throughout the day and deep into the night. On top of this, they always drink beer past regulated hours and nothing is done. The law and the town council regulations states that there should be no large gatherings and no noise and alcohol after 10.30pm. On top of that with the new social distancing rules, no gatherings of more than 10 and no intentional seating within 1m, its pretty obvious to me that these offences are punishable by the law, yet nothing is done. I have been calling the police multiple times a week since last year and filed 2 police reports, one in nov 2019 and once in jan 2020, but nothing is done. They told me they have informed town council and i emailed the town council as well, but nothing has changed. Worse part of this is that when i call the police, they rarely show up. They are always busy or come with insufficient numbers to handle the drunken men. On average i have to call them 5 times before they show up. Just last night, i made 5 calls to the police from 10.30pm to 1.30 am and the police did not show up. They told us they did not have enough manpower. This is utterly embarrassing to know that our police force which is supposed to uphold the law and order is incapable of providing a response. With the upcoming tightening of measures for the COVID-19, i am unsure if they will abide by those rules. It is most likely that they will countinue their gatherings and disturb the order in the neighbourhood. I require a long term solution to solve this issue rather than making constant calls to the police and hoping that they will come. I have lessons in the morning and sleeping is difficult with them around. What can i do about this? I am truly sick of it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Gathering of men very frequently, making loud noise and drinking alcohol late into the night(1am+) for the past 6 months. The police don't show up when called and the town council does nothing about it. Where can i find a solution?

fvtths,1586155647,fvtths,0,,"Hi people. I'm writing this here as I'm concerned for a friend. He's working for a large retail store (name shall not be mentioned) as a customer service officer, full operational and usually face-to-face with customers over the counter. Due to COVID-19, the store has to close as it's not part of essential service. After PM Lee's announcement on Friday, the company itself on the same day has put out an official statement for the co-workers, that they will still be paid full salary during the circuit breaker period and that everyone will WFH. My friend's department will be given an 'assignment' to do at home instead. At least that's what they were told at first. 

Yesterday, my friend said that the department's manager announced due to their e-Commerce still operating, meaning they're still accepting online orders from customers, instead of WFH, they must come to work back-end in the store for 2 consecutive days, and then given OFF for 2 days subsequently. The store's HR also claimed they have been given permission by the government on this, that they are allowed to still come to work to settle the online order. This is contrary to what Lawrence Wong said yesterday, that ""if your business is not in the list of essential services, you either have to telecommute 100%, or stop work altogether"".  My friend and his colleagues were also told to wear 'civilian' to work, meaning they should not wear their usual store uniform at work and on the way to work. This part makes me doubt whether they really did obtain permission from government to continue operating back-end. Mind you, my friend's department is the only department who was asked to come back to the store to work to settle back-end orders although the store is technically closed. The company's office staffs are all on WFH. 

My question is, is this practice normal or am I just thinking too much? Should I report this practice and if I should, where can I report this to?

fwkb51,1586265292,fwkb51,0,,"Hi. My mother who is a flight attendant lost her source of income due to the Covid-19 virus. As such, she has chosen to take up many odd jobs and has recently taken one up at a hospital, where she serves patients (in the non-infectious disease wards) food and clears trays etc. She is bent on receiving a source of income instead of staying at home and keeping herself and our family safe (she is already older than 50, so she isn't invincible). This is really causing me a lot of unnecessary stress on top of my whole university schedule being postponed and possible retraction of internship opportunities. However, she will not listen to any of us, and even goes out to her friend's house and insists on taking the job at the hospital.

My ex-colleague, an intern from overseas, has been here since Feb, and is supposed to be here till September. She is in a dire financial situation; she receives $800 as her stipend, and her rental and utilities total up to $750.  After rental and utilities, she's only left with \~$50 a month to survive.  Previously, her family used to send her an additional $150 every month, but they have stopped as they lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 shitshow. Also, they're not very well to do, to begin with. I'm wondering if there are any organisations out there which are open to helping foreigners on a training employment pass. 

Another question I have is this - her current land lord mandates that before they leave the house, they must find another tenant or their deposit of $1.5k will be forfeited. That has prevented her from moving out to a HDB with lower rental costs. Is that even legal? 

My situation at home doesn't allow me to offer her a place to stay, and I can't help her financially as I am not financially solvent. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

There is no limit to how you can do your daily entries, you can choose to put ten thousand memes on your slide, express your feelings through poetry, morse code, in gifs etc.

fyg3ut,1586526427,fyg3ut,0,,"How is “we should stay at home” an unpopular opinion? It’s echoed worldwide, and is as common as it is sensible. You know what would be unpopular? The possibility that isolation and lockdowns turn out to be temporary solutions; that the virus flares up once restrictions are eased. When we come to that, some uncomfortable questions need to be asked. What is the nominal value of avoiding casualties? Its not actual cash, obviously, but an accounting measure that helps us weigh different things like our jobs, the economy, our values, the value of lives, etc.

A year-long lockdown/free-to-roam on/off cycle with consumers stuck at home half the time would obviously hurt GDP. But more than that it would’ve taken its toll on our mental health as we endure months upon months at home. Investments would be postponed further and innovation and productivity stall; the cranking of the economic engine to get back to normalcy would be more strenuous.

Yes, when a team of young footballers are stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand, the world comes together to demonstrate the strength of the human spirit, of our shared values, with no consideration of cost - as it should be, and that’s good. But during wartime or crises, tough questions have to be asked, and responsible leaders will have to find a way to weigh the costs against the benefits.

As much as I am loathe to say it - when the Orange Man in the US suggested that the “cure mustn’t be worse than the virus” - he does have a valid point, however unpopular it may be. And I say these having just recovered from bronchitis a year earlier - not sure if that qualifies as a pre-existing condition.

Point is, we may have to recognise that the costs of distancing might just outweigh the benefits. I’m just glad I’m a normie who doesn’t have to make that call - I’d hate to take the flak and vilified for doing what’s economically necessary and pragmatic, but morally tough to swallow.",,An actual unpopular opinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fyg3ut/an_actual_unpopular_opinion/

On safe distancing measures for smokers

Can I leave my home to smoke and can I remove my mask to smoke outside?

You must put on a mask when you leave your home and you may only leave your home for essential purposes, such as to work in essential services or to buy food. Leaving your home, just to smoke, is not an essential purpose. If you are out for an essential purpose and have to smoke, you may do so in an area where smoking is not prohibited under the smoking prohibition law, with the mask removed. However, you must put your mask back on immediately after smoking and keep a safe distance of at least 1 metre from others. Do not loiter around after smoking or socialise with other smokers.  

NEA will continue its enforcement for safe distancing and smoking prohibition. The fines for smoking prohibition offence and violation of safe distancing measures are $200 and $300 respectively. In addition, second-time offenders of the safe distancing measures will face a $1,000 composition fine, or prosecution in court for egregious cases.",,FAQ from NEA for smokers,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g4843p/faq_from_nea_for_smokers/

1. Many studies have shown that your satisfaction with life is greatly linked to the relationships in your life.
2. Imo people's support is actually really unstable and you can't really trust that even your closest friends will stick around forever.
3. Thus, the ideal situation is that you don't rely on friends/companionship for happiness because it's so unreliable
4. But is this feasible? Possible evidence for this would be monks/hermits I guess. 
5. Personally I would like to not have a desire for companionship because I find it very hindering. Is it possible to actually remove this?

*I used to look forward to going to the mosque every Ramadan. For many reasons: finding peace after a a long day at work, and free servings of the mosque's porridge. One of my favourite memory of this porridge was from last year at Masjid Ahmad Ibrahim.*

&amp;#x200B;

*I came to the mosque later than usual after getting caught in pretty bad traffic, and there hardly was any space for me to sit down to break my fast. The imam had already finished reciting the call to prayer, and everyone was halfway through their meals. I thought to myself, that's okay. I'll grab some dates, join the prayer, and get some McDonalds' after terawih (night prayers during Ramadan).*

&amp;#x200B;

*As I walked towards the table with a plate of dates, a South Asian brother tapped my shoulder and offered me some space in between him and his friend.*

&amp;#x200B;

*""Brother, come eat,"" he said.*

&amp;#x200B;

*I replied to say that it was okay, that I just needed some dates and water.*

&amp;#x200B;

*""No, no come brother,"" he insisted. ""You can have my porridge, I have already eaten some rice.""*

&amp;#x200B;

*His friend beside him opened the bottle of poppadom and said I should try mixing the porridge with the poppadom. ""I fry myself before I come to mosque,"" he said. ""You try, ok? Come brother, come eat.""*

&amp;#x200B;

*That day, I became friends with Abdul Kader and Muneer.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Fast forward to today, where we see daily case updates on those infected with COVID, the rising numbers. Our mosques are closed (for good reasons, of course), and you read reports on how the foreign worker dormitories are affected.*

&amp;#x200B;

*To Abdul Kader and Muneer, and your friends from all the dormitories - I want you to know that you, my brothers, will be taken care of by Singapore's medical team. You will be given the same quality of care, no matter where you are from, what you believe in, the colour of your skin, the language that you speak.*

&amp;#x200B;

*I know this for sure because my wife is a nurse, and my brother-in-law is stationed at the medical post in one of the dorms. No matter how high the numbers may seem, no matter how dark and never-ending this feels, I want you to know that you will be taken care of. You have spent so much time building our country. So now, you rest. We will take care of you. Singapore will take care of you, no matter where you come from.*

&amp;#x200B;

*As I write this, my newborn son sleeps in his crib soundly while his mother leaves the house for another day of battle. I hope you know that she, together with her colleagues, together with the rest of our frontline workers, are working so hard. When she returns home at night, she wishes so hard that she could hug her son but alas, by the time she is home, he is asleep. She tells me that sometimes, it feels like she's a million miles away from our son.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Then I think of you, and I cannot even begin to imagine being physically apart from your family in times like this. It must be so hard for you.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*For all of you.*

&amp;#x200B;

*This Ramadan, for each time I prostrate to the ground, know that I will pray for you, for this pandemic to be over, for hearts to be at ease. Have faith that this too shall pass.*

&amp;#x200B;

*All around the world there is madness, derived from this pandemic. But brother, know that Singapore will take care of you, no matter where you come from.*

&amp;#x200B;

*May peace be upon you.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Your brother,*

*disclaimer, i know how serious covid is..
* THIS HAPPENED 2 MONTH AGO, before wearing masks are mandatory.
*im 20 and he is 35+ (called up the clinic to ask)


one month ago, i went to a doctor in clementi to get my wounds fixed up primary reason. (one of doctors under my insurance)..

The nurses did not ask if i had flu symptoms, just checked for fever and whether I came into contact with covid-19 diagnosed patients.

I went into the room, told the doctor i was there to dress my wounds up.. since my insurance was paying I told him I have abit of phlegm as well. the doctor immediately told me to get out and wear a mask.. taken aback, I informed him I did not know I had to wear a mask bc your nurses did not inform me AND i thought of myself.. phlegm was a symptom? He shouted that i was being very socially irresponsible. something he used very often during this whole time

I stood up and went out to get a mask, he shouted at me to get all my belongings with me saying that it’s contagious and he didn’t want it on his table. and how socially irresponsible i was. oh and he chased my boyfriend who was in the room out as well. 

the nurses gave me those surgical ones that u have to tie.. i took the mask and returned to the room alone while trying to tie the mask.

he AGAIN shouted at me to get out and come back when it’s tied.. I was so taken aback, I asked him why is he talking to me this way. I’m just trying to comply with all his demands despite not being informed to. He told me I should know since I signed a declaration (I DID NOT, the nurses just verbally asked me) According to the infectious disease act this is unacceptable (he kept quoting this). I explained I didn’t know and that I was sorry, he shouted “ILL SCOLD THE NURSES” and shouted something to the nurses through the window.

he raised his voice at me again. feeling very very very unsafe i asked if I record this consultation. firstly, He did not act like a doctor shld. secondly, i was physically smaller, younger too. lastly, he chased my boyfriend out of the room.

He immediately stood up, went outside and started to shout at me in front of the whole clinic (a small clinic but filled with people). He told my boyfriend i was causing a lot of trouble and he will not be seeing me. In front of everyone, he pointed at me and said I was endangering everyone bc i don’t want to wear a mask. citing that he will be forgoing the patient doctor agreement bc i was a troublemaker. 

The entire time I was still trying to tie the damn mask with strings.

I was shock and tearing up. I told him he should not be talking to a patient like that. and showed him I was trying to tie my mask!!!! I asked for his name. He immediately threatened to call the police on me. I left the clinic completely shocked and scarred.

Not long after, the nurses called me to come back and gave me his name. Told me that they support me if I’m going to report him bc they couldn’t stand him too.

If you be quoting the infectious disease act and how socially irresponsible I was constantly, why did u turn me away for consultation? What if I really had covid? you just knowingly pushed a patient with covid to the public, a ticking time bomb waiting to infect others and further spreading the disease??

AND If my symptoms were so serious that I must be wearing a mask, why did u chase me back to the public? since you chased me back the public, meaning my symptoms weren’t severe, why did u insist I had to wear mask? 

I know this is a stressful time for all, shouldn’t the people at the front line not be panicking this way? at the point of time, our government was telling us to not panic, yet the very people that is treating us is panicking. If you’re going to panic so badly, please please please don’t be a doctor at this period.

I know not all doctors are like him, but damn, when I see ads on thanking our front line workers, i immediately think of him and start to get ptsd, anxiety all.

Personal opinion
For groceries, I generally prefer Fairprice as their app is much easier to handle. However, with increasing demand from people trying to buy stuff from there , some things like Campbell mushroom soup is almost always out of stock.

Songfish is a Store i recommend to all those that like seafood and frozen salmon . Nice products and I love the fact that all our stuff comes in refrigerated bags.

I omitted out QB food as their earliest delivery time is at 2 June (really) but do note that if you want nice cheeses( especially in bulk)and nice quality meats, do check them out.

Finally , support your local minimarts. You will be surprised to see some of the things they have in store ( Mom brought mushroom soup from there 😊😊😊)

g8eiuw,1587908436,g8eiuw,0,,"Since our government has told us that staying at home is really good for everyone. But I somehow felt I'm going crazy.

Back story;
Being born in a typical Asian family, the son in the family is always the favourite. And it doesn't help with him being very good with his studies. Because he's so good in his studies (Straight As) he gets away with almost anything! I didn't have a very good relationship with my Mum because when I was younger, everything I did was nothing compared to my younger brother! As the eldest, I'm supposed to set a good example and give in to my younger brother. And because studying wasn't my thing, I barely made it during exams. And you guessed it, I'm always getting the rod. No matter how hard I tried, I was never enough. So I grew up with hatred and obviously I didn't have a very good childhood. Eventually I became rebellious because that would get me the attention which I could never get at home. I hate going home because that would mean I'll hear her nagging every single day. Even when I'm an adult right now, I still hate coming home. 

The Mother
Everything she says just irks me and I feel I'm battling with this devil inside of me asking her to shut up. Regardless whether it's good or bad, there's always something to nitpick about. When I'm home early, she would ask why. When I'm home late, she'd ask the same thing as well. I can never have peace at home. 

The Father
he's really nice to me and I got nothing against him. Just him being inconsiderate annoys the shit outta me. Due to covid, we should be mindful about everything else. And the things he does really annoys me. Take for example earlier. We were having dinner, he doesn't cover his mouth when sneezing. It's just disgusting thinking about the food that is on the table. He asked if I'd like fruits and I decline politely because I saw what he did. He blew his nose and didn't wash his hands and went on cutting fruits for whoever. I stopped eating fruits at home unless I had to. And every time he starts a conversation, he asks questions which I honestly have no answers. Then he goes on talking about other stuff that is not related on the topic he was talking about earlier. Now you might be thinking, all the things he has done, why didn't I tell him not to. Well I did and it's not working. 

The Brother 
Because he's on his way to getting a PhD, he gets away with everything. He's like the king at home and this is due to my parents spoiling him too much! When food is packed, they'll walk into his room to serve it to him. When he's done, they'd eventually come in and clear it for him.. He's basically just playing games and doing stuff on his computer and nothing else. Doesn't help with house chores at all. And earlier for that dinner, I had to clear the dishes, wash them and mop the whole kitchen because I'm a girl and have to do it. 

These are little things that I've accumulated over the years and it just hasn't gotten any better. There's just too many to list and the hatred I have for my mother just kept growing and that is why everything she says just annoys me. And my brother's King behavior has just gone completely off partially due to my parents. I even thought of buying or renting a house but that would mean that I will not have enough money to survive every month just for freedom due to my mere pay. 

I basically tried everything you could ever think of and it all doesn't work. 
-close my room door
-listening to calming music
-watching comedies 
-distracting myself watching netflix or Korean drama
-doing yoga 

The only thing that is keeping me sane right now is me going to work. I only WFH on Fridays. 

I realized my condition has became worse due to the following reasons:
1) My anxiety attacks are more frequent
2) I cry when I watch comedies thinking that it'll help me
3) I cry myself to sleep sometimes at night
4) I became numb to everything that is happening at home
5) sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel empty, sometimes I feel exhausted 
6) I don't know what to think and each time my mind starts to think how I can find more solutions with me listening to music and staring into blank space, my head hurts so much

&amp;#x200B;

Not helping any with Singapore’s image as home to a bunch of crazy-rich Asians comes the almost too-ridiculous-to-be-true story of a man who rented a swimming pool for S$10,000 ($7,040) a month.

Faced with the prospect of not being able to swim in his condominium pool, which is closed because of Singapore’s strict lockdown measures, the British expat cast around his neighbors’ properties.

He initially wanted to lease the entire S$30 million bungalow in [Sentosa Cove](https://www.sentosacove.com/), an upscale residential area on an island off Singapore’s south coast. But the monthly rent of S$30,000 was too high, considering it would have been on top of the not insubstantial amount he was paying for a nearby apartment, according to Lester Chen, a real estate agent at [Singapore Realtors Inc.](https://sri.sg/)

“I asked the man why he wanted to rent the bungalow. Is it because of space restraint in his current home?” said Chen, who handled the lease and declined to disclose his client’s personal details. “The man replied that he just wanted to use the pool because his was closed due to the lockdown.”

With Singapore entering its fourth week of a partial lockdown that has now been extended until June 1 to reduce a surge in coronavirus cases, people are barred from loitering outdoors. Public facilities such as sport halls and gyms are closed. Similarly, amenities in condos are shut to deter social mixing. Individuals face possible fines, jail terms or suspension of their work permits for non-compliance.

Since his client only wanted to use the pool in the Bali-themed house, Chen came up with a proposal.

“I spoke to the owner and we agreed to lease out the pool and garden on two conditions. First, it will only be a short-term lease of three months. And if someone else wanted to rent the bungalow in its entirety, we can terminate the agreement,” he said.

The two parties signed a deal on Sunday. While the house itself is locked to prevent entry, the man and his family have access through a side gate. The bungalow is a 10-minute jog from his condo, or a short golf-buggy drive away.

Chen said there have been similar requests, with individuals wanting to rent bungalows in Sentosa Cove only because of their private pools and gardens. But that option isn’t available to people living on the mainland, he said.

“I’ve rented out offices, factories, apartments and bungalows. But never just the amenities in a home. This was a first,” he said.",,"The British Expat Paying $7,000 to Swim in Singapore’s Lockdown",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g9k7x8/the_british_expat_paying_7000_to_swim_in/

gcqnsv,1588512813,gcqnsv,0,,"One thing that I noticed is that insurance agents LOVE to preach. They preach about gratitude, they preach about doing good for their communities, they preach about how fulfilling it is to do good. 

A perfect example happened during this entire Circuit Breaker period. A particular insurance agent on my feed wanted to preach about how to do sales and keeping the course (I believe continue selling and earning commissions) during the COVID-19 pandemic. So agent decided to organise a webinar. \~sounds fair most stuff have to be virtually now anyways\~. TO MY HORROR, said webinar was filmed LIVE, with a co-host, another star performer within their agency. To an audience of 15,000 (supposedly). Out of this 15,000 (supposedly) audience, did anyone fail to recognise that this was in direct breach of the circuit breakers rules? Submitting and processing claims is an essential business, that I can believe. But selling insurance in these times, how is that even essential?!

To compound things better, and to do good for the community, said insurance agent went on a spree, delivering care packages to her clients all over Singapore, whilst posting (preaching) on social media. about what it means to take care of communities. TAKING CARE OF COMMUNITIES MEANS STAYING HOME, not going out and meeting countless people and thus exposing others to the risk of cross infection, mask or no mask. 

Well these activities, did not go unnoticed, and apparently someone reported the said agent to the police. 

Said agent went on to post about it on social media, saying how can people be so evil and he will continue to path of what's right and doing what's right for his client. Breaking circuit breaker rules is breaking circuit breaker rules. No two ways about it. These rules are there for a reason, and nothing can mask (pun intended) the fact that going out to meet people beyond the household is ***socially irresponsible***!",,Insurance Agents Delivering Care Packages during CB,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gcqnsv/insurance_agents_delivering_care_packages_during/

Cant believe its only CB that allow me to find reddit and such an interesting community!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, on to my questions:

1. Is it possible for a parent to take CPF from a child/siblings' account to pay for their medical bills? 

1b. I assume they will collateralize the parents' HDB first and other forms as payments before doing extreme measures such as the above point right?

2. One step up, assuming no HDB + no assets + no money: if the child is not in SG, say working overseas and staying out of SG for last X # of years for long periods of time and owns an HDB, can the parent take the HDB (in the event that OA of the child is empty since it is used to buy HDB), sell it (or forcefully collateralize it), and pay for said medical bills?

3. If OA is empty, I assume then they will take it from the MA of the child?

Any thoughts or experiences involving the cascading escalation of forcefully taking CPF monies from family members to share?

Please don’t rush down as there are a few things we would like you to note.  


Most of our restaurants will be open from 7am to 9pm. During this Circuit Breaker period, we won’t be offering 24-hour service, and our Dessert Kiosks and McCafé® counters will remain closed. Some restaurants will have different opening hours and those located in parks, tourist attractions, and some institutions will also remain closed.  


We hope you’ll understand as this allows us to reduce the number of crew members in our restaurants and lets our more senior staff stay safely at home. Please be patient if it takes longer than usual for us to prepare your favourites.  


If you visit us for a takeaway, let’s work together to observe all safety measures such as temperature-taking, safe distancing guides, as well as SafeEntry registration. With your kind co-operation, we can create a safe and considerate experience for everyone!  


Or better still, simply order via McDelivery® or GrabFood. With your safety in mind, McDelivery® will be 100% contactless and will only accept cashless payments.

In a recent ruling, judges at the German Federal Supreme Court (BGH) confirmed that the measles virus does not exist. Furthermore, there is not a single scientific study in the world which could prove the existence of the virus in any scientific literature. This raises the question of what was actually injected into millions over the past few decades.

gmk5yj,1589874559,gmk5yj,0,," My dad has been buying contraband cigarettes from an uncle for 4-5 years, at a cheaper price than those sold in convenience stores. The uncle would usually visit my house and pass my dad the cigarettes wrapped in newspapers (usually in carton/s). The problem is that he is a heavy smoker and blows the smoke throughout the whole house. The smell of those contraband cigarettes is extremely pungent and choking, even more so than legal cigarettes. My mum and I always feel suffocated at home and we would hide in our rooms and not go out unless necessary. When we are outside our rooms, we would wear masks but the smell can still penetrate through. So I always try to hold my breath, especially when passing by him. I've tried convincing him to quit smoking but of course it didn't work. Also, I've tried reporting the illegal sale of cigarettes via the SG customs app several times, but I don't think the seller has been caught yet. I've also come across such strong smell of cigarette smoke below my block (near the neighbourhood police station ironically?), so I suspect that the seller is supplying to quite a few people in H\*\*\*\*\*\*... During this cb period, our problem is even more serious as he keeps smoking at home 24/7 (except when he's sleeping). I'm also worried that the contraband cigarettes may contain many banned harmful substances which might have made my dad become more addicted to smoking &gt;&lt; Meanwhile I don't get where those people get their supply of contraband cigarettes with closed borders of SG?

grgewu,1590571246,grgewu,0,,"After the 500 dollars payout the government assured the public that more supports would be made available. One of this was the ""Covid-19 Support Grant"".  


Link to Covid-19 Support Grant: [https://www.msf.gov.sg/assistance/Pages/covid19relief.aspx](https://www.msf.gov.sg/assistance/Pages/covid19relief.aspx)  


The details are as above. It is important to understand how this Support Grant was sold to the public: support for ALL of **whom lost their job after Jan 23**.  


While ""due to Covid-19"" is mentioned, it is neither elaborated, or further explained in detail on the website or elsewhere  


From the website above:  


""Full-time or part-time employees affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 situation (loss of job/income or start of involuntary no-pay leave should have occurred after 23 Jan 2020)""  


Instead, the brackets seem to imply - that the dates **""after 23 Jan""** \- would be the key central deciding stipulation for this grant.  


Ok fair enough.  


However once people did start applying or in my case went down personally to the SSO Office itself, the story and tone changed drastically!  


Now the MSF officers told me the job loss - **""must be due to COVID-19""**. When queried further on how to prove this, the officers quietened their tone, saying ""they would ask the employer for explicit proof stating **""due to COVID-19""**. The employer has the final say, after which the claim would be rejected.  


This greatly upset me. Firstly how does one fairly and truthfully prove this **""due to Covid-19""**.  


Employers can give any number of reasons even if the case was clear-cut and MSF is obliged to listen to the employer (boss) not the employee? What if things soured the business itself due to Covid-19 and the employer thought it good enough reason to dismiss employees who they already had issues with. Thus the employer gets the final say and is able to further retaliate on the employee?  


Of course, it is easy to conjure up hundreds of different scenarios and why having the employer, the final say in explicitly mentionning **""due to Covid-19""** is greatly troubling.  


How will the employee ever get to be heard in a fair and just manner? Are the courts at hand to provide assistance to give a fair trial to hear both sides in a just way? Who decides? And how?  


Surely MSF must have foreseen this? They deal with social issues, squabbles of all kinds on a regular basis, no?  


Now let's look at the MSF website and its wording, its emphasis on the stipulations mentioned. Does it ever go to emphasize how **""due to Covid-19""** is important to prove on their website? They surely do mention several other irrelevant stipulations but fail to elaborate on how the applicant needs to prove the impossible - **""due to Covid-19""**.  


Why does the MSF hotline, seems so muddled with no access to speak to an MSF officer at all? Surely MSF can hire or delegate temp staff to answer to public queries? Was this intentional to not be able to speak to an officer and only automation? Their email is equally useless as well.  


The truth is that :  


MSF have no intention of helping vulnerable unemployed Singaporeans with this nonsense Covid-19 Support grant. If they really wanted to help they would be clearer on how to prove ""due to covid-19"" as well provided the necessary staff support.  


They did neither.  


It was simply a public gesture to keep the public calm and give an impression - ""don't worry, we are here to help""  


Singapore doesn't care about its own citizens. It has always been an every man for himself society. Don't for a second be fooled into thinking the government is going to help out anyone, let alone the unemployed.  


Meritocracy remember?  


I am a Minister because i studied hard, got a scholarship and went to Oxbridge. Oh, you didn't?  


Too bad! Now get out of my elite uncaring face!

Need Advice/Got fired suddenly

Hi all. I recently got fired by my boss on my off day without any notice.

I want to file a case against him to MOM but not sure if I can. I got employed during the last week of February 2020. I cant remember if i did sign any employment contract but im sure he did not give me a hard or soft copy. I asked if there is any medical or staff benefit he said no. So after working for a month plus, circuit breaker happened and i was forced to stay home and take my lowly basic pay of $500 per month (im working jn sales thus the low basic). I recently resume work on the first day of phase 2 but up till now i have yet to receive my 2 months pay during circuit breaker. My pay is in cash form and my ex boss said he will be paying everything in the first week of july. I received my cpf contribution for the circuit breaker period already and soft copy pay slip. Just have yet to get my salary. I asked for my termination letter so it is helpful for me to claim loss of job due to covid grant. Upon asking for it, my boss wants me to provide 2 mc which i took during march(2days) and june(1day). I have the mc for march but not june because my colleagues told me that boss doesn’t require me to show mc. This isnt much of a problem. Im not sure if i can take him to MOM for being a shady boss who doesnt gives employment contract and fires ppl without notice. He claims that the termination is due to bad economy and because im the newest there so thats why he is letting me go. I doubt that is the case because i know there will be a new employee coming in this week and that there is a newer colleague who join the company 1 month later than me and didnt get terminated. I need help and advice:( im just a young girl trying to earn a living.

I dont think i can ask for salary in lieu due to the fact that there wasnt any employment contract stating any notice period.

I gave him till next wednesday to pay my 3 months worth of basic. If he doesnt do that then im filling late salary payment? Im afraid that if i file a report against him now, i cant get my pay. Cause pay is in cash form and he can deny that he gave me already. But we always sign a form when collecting our cash salary.",,need help,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hfkvl2/need_help/

hm2qqb,1594018402,hm2qqb,0,," From Lee Hsien Yang (Sunday 5 July 2020) :  


""CHARACTER AND COURAGE  


This election year, Singapore is seeing a surge of credible and capable alternative candidates. They are caring and authentic. Many have impressive qualities and qualifications. But what matters even more is their preparedness to speak out fearlessly for the needs of their fellow Singaporeans.  


Standing for the opposition needs character and courage in a way that standing on a PAP ticket does not. It demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice for our country. Alternative candidates have often been victims of unfair treatment, character assassination, and dissuasion from frightened family and friends. These candidates step forward to seek justice and equality for all. They have chosen to speak out because they are concerned for the future of our country.  


Contrast this to the monochrome of PAP candidates. For many, entering the political arena appears like a career step. They are supported by a huge machinery, have the benefits of makeovers and the prospect of a parachute into Parliament on the coat-tails of a Minister.  


Do we really want Parliament to be a mere stepping stone from a senior position in the SAF or civil service or some government-related body to higher office? Have paper qualifications and years of “grooming” created better or stronger leaders? Has the PAP system enhanced the performance of our 4G leaders? Do we want to perpetuate the PAP’s “natural aristocracy”?  


PAP MPs can generally expect smooth careers, some into Cabinet and other very highly paid political positions, others with directorships and various other positions. Given party expectations and obligations, and the party whip, they rarely speak up in Parliament to question issues of importance and they predictably vote as the party directs. For them, entering politics looks like a calculated career move rather than a sacrifice or service.  


Not for them the path of Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who has always been his own man, and that rare MP who exercised independence of mind. Unlike him, even moderate PAP MPs can become part of the group-think.  


Opposition MPs will question unpopular policies. They will fight any attempt by the PAP to raise GST. They can question outrageous ministerial salaries and conflicts of interest at Temasek and elsewhere. They will continue to question oppressive laws that silence rights to free speech and public assembly. Speaking their minds and tenacious questioning is how they will protect us from abuse of power and help create transparency and accountability. “Ownself check ownself” does not work.  


The Workers Party MPs ferreted out how $22 billion of stimulus spending for the Covid-19 pandemic is actually loan capital. They challenged the Constitution amendments on how we elect our President. The list of issues they have spoken up on is extensive: the government’s population white paper, corruption in GLCs, HDB leases, MRT breakdowns, our CPF, spending on foreign students, the Administration of Justice Act, the Prevention of Harassment Act and POFMA.  


For accountability, we need our elected representatives in Parliament to be willing to speak up and uncover the truth behind the PAP’s claims. We need them to be our voices and our vote in Parliament.  


Have your voices actually heard in Parliament.

hohl5p,1594351506,hohl5p,0,,"So I’m in Sec 2 and we just had our science teacher changed again in the start of the year for like the 4th time in 1 year. And he is arguably the worst cher in sg. I know I sound like as if I know everything liddat but hear me out. Let’s call this guy Ktc. So in the first lesson ktc already feels abit off, he’s very jittery and the way he talk is a bit different but I thought it’s because he’s a new teacher and inexperienced since he looks quite young thus I didn’t think too much. So first lesson very good, he just want to get to know we all only. But come the next few lessons when ktc start to teach us, all hell broke loose. Let me summarize: Ktc doesn’t know what he’s doing. Every lesson he just read straight from the slides and that’s called teaching. You know what’s worse? Everytime he tries to explain he slides in ‘detail’, he’s just making shit up which makes no sense and he repeats the same explanation over and over for 30 mins on the same slide. Oh and he speaks really softly so that he can Ensure only ghost can hear. This is the same when he going through corrections. One mcq question, he spend almost one whole period to explain it and his explanation is basically bs. As for structured questions? One whole period. Bloody hell even after 3 lessons we hadn’t even finish going through the f-ing worksheet finish. And the way he talk to us like Ivan Lim liddat, think he damn Zai one. Ok so only his teaching methods got problem right? Just get our year head to talk to him can liao. But then things started to go crazy. Next lesson, when ktc ask one of my classmates to stand up and say the answer to a workbook question, the classmate ended up explaining a bit more than required as she felt that ktc had just jumped straight into the question without any explanation( which was true), then u know what ktc do? He scold her. That’s right. Ktc scolded her for not paying attention and following instructions when she basically just wanted to try and be helpful. If u think that’s not outrageous, this incident should be able to convince u. A few days later, he ask us to create a name stand because he cannot remember our names. Fine. He then proceeds to spend 15 mins telling us how to make that stand. I was like Bruh, we not p1, don’t spend so much time on this, we want to study one. Then got one classmate found a more Creative way to make the stand, you know what ktc do? Scold her. Again saying she never follow instructions. Some more his scolding is as if we had committed a crime liddat, his tone and everything was really just trying to insult her. At this point we were starting to get fed up. Plus, at the end of the lesson, he said this :” See ah cause of y’all we cannot finish going through the paper( which we had been trying to finish for 4 lessons already mr!!!!)”. At this point we were so ready to shout at him, and our chance came at the next lesson. Next lesson, he told us we must use a green pen to do corrections and must do it proactively, like bruh we not first time do corrections. Then there was this other classmate that wasn’t feeling well at that point in time. So when ktc was waking around to Ensure everyone was “following instructions” as if we were p1 kids, he saw this girl who wasn’t feeling well and instead of asking her what happen, he just straight up said:”Why never do (corrections) in green pen”. At this point we had enough, some of our classmates stood up for her and said she not feeling well. You know what this tung guy said? Y’all should work together as a class to help her. B*TCH WE DIDNT DO NO SHIT WRONG. SHES FINE HELP HER IN WHAT KNN. Some more he take up our entire recess to argue with us. Then that one pai kia in the class stood up, called him a monkey, and scolded him like a champ. I regret not scolding him as well but anyways, then this tung guy told pai kia to stand up. When pai kia didn’t want to stand up, he grab his shirt and tried to pull him up but he too weak liao, in the end we had to get the people who were gathering around our class to watch the fight to call our math teacher an hour later who was also our year head to end the matter. You guys should have seen that look on his face and he walked out of the class, he realised he was so done lol. Lucky our year head’s lesson was next and she willingly gave up her lesson time so we can have our recess. At least saints do exist. So over the weeks he was sent for counselling and couldn’t teach our class. Our ex science cher took over and I think ktc was either sitting at the back of the class or was not in the class during this period I can’t remember. Then COVID came and so did hbl. Nothing much happened here until school just reopened recently. I will talk about this in another post as this one is getting to Long. Thanks to everyone who read this post, at least it allowed me to cool down a little. Sorry admins for the vulgar words, I got a bit hot headed there. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Science cher was Super slow in teaching, spent 5 lessons going through a worksheet and scolded multiple classmates just because they used a more Creative or different way than he was expecting to complete a task. Ended up in a big fight between us and him one day which took 1h before Chers were alerted to the matter and the science cher ended up being sent for consultation.

i2n1ne,1596414309,i2n1ne,0,,"28 weeks into my sister's pregnancy, unexpectedly, she had to run into labor due to her complications and they welcomed Sukriti into this world. But due to her very premature birth, Sukriti was advised to be in [NICU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit) at [NUH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_Hospital).

Both my sister and my brother in law are currently residing in Singapore. In January this year, after the pregnancy was discovered, they planned to travel to India for the baby birth. That's when the COVID came into the picture and with all the travel ban and the risk of catching the virus, they decided to conduct labor in Singapore.

But the premature complication was totally unexpected for all of us. Before we ended our celebration, we kind of foresaw what was coming. The total charges for the baby girl's NICU came up to SGD $206K (approx. USD $149K). Since both of them were foreigners to the country they were residing, they had no financial assistance nor subsidy provided. They had to pretty much sum up all of their life savings to cover the costs.

The [Indian Rupee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee) to Dollar conversion really hit us hard (we were of Indian Nationality). And SGD $206K is an astronomical value in Indian currency. Unfortunately, this year, I took a decision to study which ended me up with using most of my savings into admission and fees. This put in a situation, unable to help her monetarily as much as I wanted to.

They have started a Give Asia funding campaign and have been able to raise **SGD $41K** for baby Sukriti. The campaign has all the bills that you can verify. Also, if you need more information, DM me and I can provide you with all information.

The COVID has put most in a situation and I can understand if you are unable to contribute at this moment. Just visit the campaign and bless the baby to recover faster.

If you can, please share it with communities that can help the campaign reach the goal. Please reach out to me if you can help me direct the campaign or if I should do something different or better.

**Please find the link to the Give Asia funding below**

Also, I have messaged r/Singapore mod team about this post and I am ready to **provide evidence** and **reference** for this fundraising. If I am doing something wrong, please let me know.

ieaqjp,1598064169,ieaqjp,0,,"If you're a student from any tertiary education institute in Singapore whether public or private, share your experiences! I'll kickstart the sharing with what NTU has implemented. 

&amp;#x200B;

# NTU

* Safe entry to every school building/foodcourt, but you are free to roam about the common areas
* Most lectures were pushed online with tutorials/labs still conducted in physical classes
* No standing in campus buses (Because COVID-19 only affects those who stand, right?)

**My observations:**

It feels like the week before finals even though we have only started the semester. Students are crowding everywhere from school buildings to common areas for their online lessons. Apparently lectures were shifted online to facilitate ""safe distancing"" and reduce the number of students on campus, but this has backfired for a simple reason - Tutorials and labs are still conducted in person. 

Most students have a mix of both online and physical lessons in a single day, with little breaks between them. To illustrate what I mean, imagine you have an online class in the morning followed by a 1 hour break before your physical class starts. If you stay &gt;1 hour away from NTU (which is very common), you have no choice but to camp in school for your online class as you will be late for your physical class if you came from home after the online class. I guess this is the main reason why we see common areas flooded with students at any time of the day. 

 **NTU has a standing agreement with COVID-19 to not infect students who are sitting down on campus buses**

But NTU should learn from LTA/SBS/SMRT as they have signed a better contract with COVID-19 to not infect anyone on board their transportation mediums, regardless of whether they're standing or sitting.",,"Tertiary students of Singapore, what COVID-19 measures have your school implemented?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ieaqjp/tertiary_students_of_singapore_what_covid19/

I've been following the conversation here for some time now as I try to acclimate myself to Singaporean culture and concerns, but haven't posted anything yet.

Now, as my arrival approaches, I have a few questions about the SHN process. So I figured I'd ask to see if anyone here might have insight/experience to share:

1. If one is arriving as a couple (e.g. myself and my wife), should we request 2 rooms? We love one another, but the thought of 15 days together in \~220 square feet is intimidating. Has anyone here done the 2 person quarantine? How'd it go?
2. Can most SHN hotels cope with dietary restrictions? I have a fairly serious diagnosed one (i.e. it isn't just ""I don't like XYZ"" but more that ""XYZ causes me serious medical issues""). I've seen the reports on SHN hotel food, and it doesn't look promising. Are hotels in Singapore responsive to dietary requests?
3. Any SHN pro-tips? I've done quarantine/lockdown in a few places now, so it isn't all new. But if you're aware of services that might be of use in Singapore, feel free to share your expertise.

So I'm a local here and I can visit country X under the 30-day visa waiver program upon entry. I'm looking to stay in that country because my partner lives there, which means every 30 days I gotta pack up and travel back to SG and then fly there again. 

I'm just curious if there's any possibility where my visa waiver might get rejected at the airport somehow, because they're suspicious why I'm travelling there every month? Or should I wait for a few days or a week before I fly up there again? Or it doesn't matter? Because I anticipate doing this every month.

I tried googling but most results are US context and that's not where I'm heading. Would appreciate any insight on this, if anyone knows or have done a similar thing before.

Here's an article I've found on the web. Is it true? Can sbd cfm? Tks.

Exclusive: NSFs volunteered to coronavirus exposure

In light of the escalating Wuhan health crisis, the Singapore government will enforce temperature screening at 9pm tonight. Parents are alarmed as their sons are forced to screen sickly passengers without adequate protection, despite the government's claim that Singapore's health system is well-prepared for the coronavirus outbreak.

The government has claimed that Singapore has been preparing for another outbreak of a similar scale after SARS and has started collaborating with Raffles Medical to conduct health screening. ""I think we are better prepared now"", the prime minister reportedly said, during a WEF meeting.

The administration so far has advised citizens not to procure N95 masks for personal use and refrain from wearing surgical masks in the public if they are healthy, as Singapore masks supply dwindled and prices surged.

According to an unnamed source, as the ministry is unable to recruit sufficient healthcare assistants, NSFs from the 41th Singapore Artillery Regiment and other units have been ""volunteered"" in enhanced temperature screening operations beginning tonight. Servicemen will be stationed at airport checkpoints and aerobridges to record temperatures for passengers for all inbound flights, particularly Chinese citizens wearing surgical masks. 

Servicemen are expected to escort sickly passengers to quarantine without protective gowns or N95 masks. ""This is the army"", a regular officer said in an internal briefing, ""we have to do this to ... protect our border health.""

The coronavirus from Wuhan, known as 2019-nCoV, has infected thousands and spread to dozens of countries. So far it has claimed a hundred lives in China and has no known cure. More alarmingly, some infected patients are asymptomatic during its incubation period, putting even well-trained healthcare professionals at risk. ""Putting the lives of ill-trained, ill-equipped, non-professional and forcefully conscripted personnel on the line"", critics noted, ""is a breach of every known code in disease control.""

Concerned parents are flocking to ask officers for clarification, but the SAF has yet to give further information.

ewqp4i,1580487331,ewqp4i,1,,"Recently, as we all know, the Wuhan virus has made its way to Singapore and there are currently around 13 confirmed cases in Singapore, all being Chinese Nationals. It is something that we all do worry about. Parents, students, elderly, we're all talking about it. The government has made some measures and introduced some policies like the travel ban to try and contain the virus and limit it's spread.  
However, recently, after reading through some comments on social media platforms of people giving their opinions on the matter and the comments and actions of the ministers, it really saddens me to see so many people criticizing the ministers, especially Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. I know that it is impossible to always get everyone to be supportive of your statements and actions. But this just didn't seem right to me (to me, my personal opinion, take it with a grain of salt). Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong along with some other ministers said that there is no need for Singaporeans to wear masks if they are not sick and it might be even counter productive.  
This comment made many Singaporeans angry and upset that the ministers are not supporting their belief of ""It's better to be safe than sorry"" and their decision to take all precautions when tackling this new virus. I can understand why, I really do. We all have loved ones, we all have friends, we all do not wish to see people that we love and care being in pain and in a life or death situation. No amount of deaths is ever too small. Life is precious.  
But after analyzing the current situation, the ministers are not wrong. The masks are limited and there is a severe shortage of them. (Note: this is a very important point) We do not have many masks to go around, let alone sustain our extreme precautionary measures for long term. And it's not likely we will be getting an abundance of them anytime soon because other nations are also getting stocked up. Facing this virus, we all should take precautions. Wearing a mask is definitely a precaution and it can offer at least a small amount of protection. But, so far there are no confirmed carriers of the virus that are not being quarantined at hospitals. One of the main ways the virus transmits is through contact. If you touch someone or something with the virus and then touch your face, the virus can enter your body through your nose, eyes or mouth. A mask cannot prevent you from contact with the virus, it just simply can't. One way to beat that is just to frequently wash your hands with soap. The other way it is transmitted is through coughs, etc. One extremely popular belief is that the standard face masks (the surgical ones) protect you from the virus. There has been little evidence that supports that claim. The actual purpose of wearing the mask is to prevent the spread of the virus when you are a suspected carrier or when you are sick (to prevent people being paranoid). And this is exactly what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in the interview. The masks should be reserved for those that are unwell and those who are fighting the virus on the front lines (doctors, nurses, etc). The masks that actually ""protect"" you from the virus are the N95 masks, not the surgical ones.

Since there is a shortage of masks, it is important to use them wisely. Right now, the situation is being handled well, and there is a very low chance you will get infected just by going outside. And if we start using the bulk of our supply right now, it would be catastrophic when there are actually confirmed cases outside hospitals and an outbreak starts in Singapore.

When the situation worsens, everyone wearing a mask is definitely warranted and I firmly believe that the government would support that. But right now, the chances of infection are still too low for that, and if we run out of masks later on, our own strategy and selfishness to ""protect"" ourselves by wearing masks when there's no need to would become our ultimate downfall.

Just like this virus situation, we buy a fire extinguisher to keep at home in order to protect us from fires when they start by putting them out. We do not buy fire extinguishers to spray around the house to prevent a fire. Bear in mind, we only have 1 fire extinguisher, and that single fire extinguisher is for us to keep and use when we need it. Don't use it before the house is on fire. Don't waste your masks.

Stay vigilant, not anxious. Use masks wisely.

Travel Information: COVID-19 Update

We are closely monitoring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization’s statements regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases and following guidelines from these agencies and the local health departments.

The wellbeing of our guests and associates is of paramount importance.

Our Cancellation Policy:
We are waiving cancellation fees for hotel stays through March 31, 2020 for guests traveling to or from the following locations:

Guests who booked directly via online travel agents or other third party travel professionals are advised to contact their booking provider for information on their policies. Please Note: This policy does not apply to travel associated with a Group booking.

Our Commitment to Cleanliness:
We take standards for hygiene and cleanliness very seriously and are taking additional steps to ensure the safety of our guests and associates.  On a daily basis, our hotels around the world are working to ensure that they meet the latest guidance on hygiene and cleaning. Our hotels’ health and safety measures are designed to address a broad spectrum of viruses, including COVID-19, and include everything from handwashing hygiene and cleaning product specifications to guest room and common area cleaning procedures. Specific steps Marriott is taking include: 

Associate Health, Safety and Knowledge: Hotel associates – and their own health, safety and knowledge – are essential to an effective cleaning program. Here are some ways we’re supporting them:
Hand Hygiene: Proper and frequent handwashing is vital to help combat the spread of viruses. In our daily meetings, our teams are reminded that cleanliness starts with this simple act. It’s important for their health and that of our guests.
Ongoing Training: In addition to training on housekeeping and hygiene protocols, hotel associates are also completing enhanced COVID-19 awareness training.
Real Time Information: Marriott’s Corporate and regional teams are on standby 24/7 to support the hotels and coordinate with local and regional authorities.

Cleaning Products and Protocols: Our hotels use cleaning products and protocols which are effective against viruses, including:
Guest Rooms: Hotels use cleaning and disinfecting protocols to clean rooms after guests depart and before the next guest arrives, with particular attention paid to high-touch items.
Public Spaces: Hotels have increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting in public spaces, with a focus on the counter at the front desk, elevators and elevator buttons, door handles, public bathrooms and even room keys.
Back of House: In the spaces where associates work “behind the scenes,” hotels are increasing the frequency of cleaning and focusing on high-touch areas like associate entrances, locker rooms, laundry rooms and staff offices.

For the most updated information, please refer to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or your local health authority.

The strict measures we have taken — border controls, restricting travel, safe distancing, suspending religious services, and closing of entertainment outlets and tuition centres — are meant to curb the spread of the disease, to flatten the curve, and slow down the infection rate. 

Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen. We too expect to see more cases, as more overseas Singaporeans return home. It is crucial for these returnees to comply strictly with their Stay Home Notices. You must protect your families and everyone else, in case you turn out to be infected, which unfortunately some returnees will be. Glad that many are behaving responsibly by staying home, but some are not. Please comply – it is irresponsible to gallivant off to eat local food you miss, or to go partying with friends, when you are supposed to stay at home and isolate yourself. You will also be breaking the law. 

Lawrence Wong spoke for us all when he gave heartfelt thanks to our healthcare workers, public officers, volunteers, and many unsung heroes who are fighting hard against COVID-19. Everyone has a part to play — be socially responsible, keep a safe distance apart from others, maintain high levels of hygiene, and heed the government advisories. It is a sombre time, but if we work together as one people, we will overcome this challenge, as our pioneers have done before.

fp36dx,1585188255,fp36dx,1,,"Since there are many posts about ""why no school closure yet?"", I shall just chip in my opinion. This is, my opinion only.

I think, the effectiveness of school closure will only be marginal, if it is not done together with a hard lockdown. By hard lockdown, I mean suspension of business activities, no work, only essetial services (healthcare, bus, train, supermarket, eateries, sanitary, ect) are allowed to continue but at reduced volume, everyone are to stay at home, only one person is allowed to go out to buy things. AKA the Wuhan style lockdown. 

Without such lockdown, school closure alone will not help much. Kids can still come out to playground, void deck to play, maids will still bring the kids everywhere they go, mix with everyone they mix, older kids will still go to friends home, or parks, ect, loiter around. As long as people are still free to go out, school closure alone will not serve much purpose. There is school clusters now. At least, schools is environment that the gov has almost total control. Who're in the school, how many in the school, it is a lot easier in terms of contact tracing. And, without hard lockdown, people will still complain about useless social distancing on public transport. Not all jobs are with the natures that allow WFH. People will still have to take public transport to work. It is especially so here because we rely on public transport to move around, unlike Malaysians who most drive or ride a bike. 

But, a hard lockdown like this, will destroy many businesses. Can the government insist companies continue paying employees salary during such period? How long will it last? How many businesses can tahan this, and for how long? How many will lose their jobs due to this, go bankrupt? How many have the reserve to support themselves, and family, for 6 months without income?

Lower income families with toddlers or school going kids will suffer the most. School closure only, they need to find extra childcare help because they can't just stay home to look after their kids, or they lose their income. Hard lockdown, likely they will lose their income, or even their jobs all together. 

It is a long battle. Even if we are not closing schools now, or having hard lockdown, eventually, I think we may and we will. Just hope that, by having all this enhanced measurements, we can shorten the period that we need to lockdown, and soften the blow to all the people, financially, socially, emotionally. Because, we definitely cannot not afford to hard lockdown the country for 3, 4 months, like Wuhan.",,The effectiveness of school closure will only be marginal without a hard lockdown,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fp36dx/the_effectiveness_of_school_closure_will_only_be/

fsyxjm,1585744468,fsyxjm,1,,"I think that although there was a delay between the time China released news of the virus and the time the outbreak occured (thus no way to have stopped the first batch of tourists/returnees from Wuhan from entering SG), we could have stopped the vast majority of cases from entering Singapore by closing our borders to at least all flights originating from Wuhan or perhaps all of China, on the first week we received notice of the virus.

So some of you may say,  that is an unreasonable course of action at the time because it was not announced as a pandemic yet, etc. so to close our borders immediately on the premise of a possibly contained virus is uncalled for. But I think that any kind of easily contact spread virus = grounds for at least immediate border closure to all flights originating from the country of the epidemic. We did not do this for MERS-CoV because MERS is difficult to transmit from person to person even with close contact, so the chances of it become a pandemic is low. But all viruses that are easily contact spread from person to person such as Covid have high potential to become pandemics. It is a cause to raise the alarm immediately. This is especially the case for Singapore because the majority of our tourists come from China and we get large numbers of Chinese tourists every day (before Covid) and therefore we are one of the most at risk communities. 

Now that we only made the decision to close borders two weeks ago, we take on an unnecessary increase in casualties and economic damage. Since the end outcome was total border closure anyway, the net loss for the country = present and future costs incurred due to additional influx of cases - revenue earned from keeping borders open for a few more weeks. If I do very simplistic calculations based on tourism and investment gains from 2018, the immediate loss incurred from a border closure on day 1 of receiving notice, is about 3 billion's worth in 3 weeks - far less than the 40+ billion we are setting aside for current and future measures.

Of course, there would be some more cases after border closure due to people getting infected with the first wave of tourists/returnees but not manifesting symptoms until 2 weeks later (hence possibly spreading it during this time). But I think it would be far less than the amount we currently have due to keeping borders open for another few weeks before closure, letting more infected people enter and spreading the disease. 

My opinion is that the initial low number of cases (80-100) and the slow rate of increase (several to ten a day) made us complacent of the situation, that we overlooked the possibility that it was the calm before the storm and that there were many potential cases still brewing in our midst (now showing symptoms). So now we have the second wave, which is all the people who came in before and during those few weeks when the borders were still open/ those that interacted with them.

So the conclusion is, if I were the government, I'd have taken a guaranteed few billions in economic loss over potential tens of billions, and closed the borders to at least all China incoming flights (or all flights) upon receiving notice of a easily contact spread widespread epidemic. Perhaps it would not have been ""reasonable"" then, but looking back at it from now it would have been the correct thing to do, since we ended up having to do it anyway. The short term infection figures from a virus with a long incubation time and being asymptomatic during that period are VERY misleading, and to base measures off those figures is a mistake that practically every country made and hence were taken by surprise by the second wave. I think this is a lesson to learn about the pattern of how pandemic cases rise and we need to prepare for the correct initial response if such situations ever happen again. Our ability to control and mitigate the impact of the outbreak is definitely top class, but it would be better if we always acted to avoid the disaster before it has a chance to occur.",,"Was closing our borders immediately the correct response to Covid, rather than delaying?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fsyxjm/was_closing_our_borders_immediately_the_correct/

This is Frustration Nation, a podcast my friends and I have wanted to start for a while. This first episode is an autopsy of the Virus Vanguard situation. We talk about the characters themselves, overanalysing them, and go into the underlying issues that this entire situation betrays. 

This episode was recorded two days ago, and as such, does not include some important updates and news that we've learnt, including the original artist's departure from the organization, and stuff about how these designs were meant to be part of a client brief and the heavy referencing of other people's work was just a way to speed up the process and not the actual design. We will probably add these updates in the next episode, but we'd just like to clarify why we don't mention these developments.

Other than that, I'm really excited to present this first episode- we had a lot of fun recording all of this, and we hope that as the weeks go by we will be able to produce more interesting and relevant content!

Here's the episode:

You can simply just wait for a notification containing your area and the current available delivery slots. Slots are gradually released throughout the day for both Redmart and Fairprice.

gd9scb,1588591248,gd9scb,1,,"&lt;this might be controversial and it might offend some so advance apologies&gt;  


I haven't been very active on Reddit for personal reasons but just felt like posting some stuff that I've been thinking about. For context: I'm currently a ""full-time"" student, but I consider myself as a part time one. I do things on the side that have enabled me to stop taking pocket money and fund my future business + retirement plans. Kinda think this whole Covid19 situation has given my gen tons to consider. Still a teenager, probably hasn't eaten as much rice as our elders have eaten salt. Constructive criticism always welcome :)

**1) Stop thinking that things are ALWAYS going to be okay**

I hate it- absolutely hate it when people go out and buy some $500 Gucci shirt and then later on start asking to borrow money from friends. It is a terrible habit and to some extent I do believe social media has perpetuated the whole ""I have a luxury item omg I'm so rich everyone look at meeeee"" idea.

Stop taking on installment plans or borrowing from friends to fund such unnecessary purchases. I'm of the view that we shouldn't just be spending WITHIN our means but BELOW them.

Having that extra cash in savings will be very useful when unexpected events occur. Cracked your phone screen? You can get it repaired on the spot. A great deal on that laptop you've been eyeing because your current one is wonky? Buy it then.

Financial freedom isn't going all out and spending everything you have on luxury items. I get it, I do actually purchase luxury goods but that is the absolute LAST PRIORITY. Settle everything else in your life first and then think about them.

**2) Never be complacent, always aim to upgrade yourself**

It is without a doubt going to be tough for fresh grads for the foreseeable future. But once things settle down and companies start hiring again, what do you think will enable you to level up? Your ability to *add value.* If you don't bother going the extra mile or making certain sacrifices that your colleagues do, do you think you deserve that promotion? There are plenty of courses out there that the government will partially or fully sponsor and no, not just skillsfuture. 

In the meantime, plenty of us are still students. If your studies are sponsored by your parents, make use of that privilege. If you are out there hustling to fund it on your own, RESPECT and that attitude will serve you extremely well in the future. Personally, I'm of the view that holidays should be spent either doing a part-time job or taking up a course on something you're interested in. Yeah, sleeping and Netflixing is cool but is that really the best use of your time? 

**3) Having more than one source of income would be ideal + invest**

To the best of our ability, I really doubt we should be relying on a paycheck or any one source to fund us entirely. There are plenty of side hustle ideas out there and I'm quite sure many of us can find a way to monetise whatever skills we have. Be it tuition, arts &amp; crafts or selling stuff the key thing is to *add value-* the money will come. Perhaps not much at first but with consistent effort things will gain momentum. 

Moving on, investment. Yes, it can be risky. But it is a risk worth taking :) If you choose to just save, you have already lost to inflation. If you choose to invest WISELY, you have a fighting chance.

*This solution/information is sacred and belong to me the savior legend. No any entity/beings is allow to using it for any purpose without my permission, or will face heavy punishment (from a warning to total vanish/dead depend on actions) by divine team/super deities/natural gods.*  
 

The only way to solve and end to land territory problem which exist for many thousands years is by having a total new global international standard accept by most people.  
 You may wonder how is that possible, then I tell you that it is very easy,and here is the way:  
 

\- **A normal/single nation:** a complete nation who the government control both military and economic system. Like the most current nations on Earth.  
 

\- **A joint nation:** a nation contain from at least 2 portion/shares nation. And those portion nation either share the same economy system or the same military defend, but must have share the same language/culture. A joint nation government will act as observer,advice provider, special report receiver from citizen like corruption, abnormal activities like virus/disease outbreak in each portion nation.  
 

\- **A portion/shares** **nation**: a nation who still have a government control almost everything like other independence nations but have some sort of “special” relationship with other portion nation in that join nation.  
 

\- **A economic nation:** a nation who the government only control the economic system while they rely on other nations for the military/safety defend at some cost.  
 

So you may have some big joint nation such as China, Korea, India, etc. and some portion nations like North Korea &amp; South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet &amp; other small portion nations in China, etc.  
 

You do not and cannot report tell the government how corrupt they are because they are acting from both player and referee job. But a joint nation government can easily remove that stupid loophole. And the benefit of a joint nation government is enormous, only “bad, corrupt” animal mindset beings do not want that happen, but many smart people want that.  
 

That is the only way to end the conflict about ego but still keep a nation within a nation &amp; everything, there is no any other way.  
 

I do not want to talk to much, but I think that is enough “cure” for the current life around land conflict.  
 

Oh, you may allow to share it to your boss but do not allow to using it for the public without my permission the savior legendary.

hdl4xh,1592799670,hdl4xh,1,,"Hey guys,

Firstly i need to say that i'm not pro-PAP, but rather pro-Singapore, so it's through these lenses that i try to view things as objectively as possible.

With the elections looming, much has been said about WP being the bastion of the people's voice (ironically not PV party..). I was wondering why other parties such as the SDP have been talking so much smack about PAP's handling of the dorm situations, but WP has been strangely quiet.

I then came across this video:  [https://www.facebook.com/thekopi.co/videos/587792631853785](https://www.facebook.com/thekopi.co/videos/587792631853785). At point 3:25 you can see LTK making a point against the govt in 2011 about housing foreign workers near existing housing estates. George Yeo said ""we should not be so concerned about votes, it's important to do what is right"" - which is true because in a democratic society, we vote the government to govern, and not carry out to the letter what the public wants (contrary to what many people believe).

WP MP Gerald Giam also put up a petition titled: Get out of my Elite neighbourhood (the video briefly covers that). It's since been deleted.

I'm no expert on this but i'd like to hear some thoughts from people here.

If one votes for the opposition to ""keep the PAP on their toes"", would we run into such a scenario such as this when we have to pay heavily down the line, where the government has to respond to the people instead of doing what's right?

 \- Personally I feel that this is a dangerous line to tread because while i understand the thinking, I can't help but wonder what if more outlier incidents happen down the line.

Would you have more respect from the WP if they came right out to admit that they made a mistake and did a u-turn?

 \- Personally I feel like I would. I have great respect for LTK and firmly believe he is good for Singapore and Singaporeans, and acknowledging it would be the right thing to do imo.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know your thoughts on this!

1) I don't want to often see PAP MPs sleeping when Parliament sessions were on going.  


2) I don't like to see Parliament so empty of MPs when Parliament is in session.  


3) I don't like to see some PAP MPs hardly asked or at most asked only a few token questions on their constituents' behalf whether it is the cost of living or transportation or educational or CPF or housing issues but collect their fat MP allowance punctually every month without fail.  


4) I want our Constitution to be solemnly respected and not changed at whim such as turning an Indian woman into a reserved Malay presidential candidate with ease.   


5) I disagree about paying political salary cum bonuses and making it into a goldmine and MPs taking up directorships in companies shouldn't be another connection or route to more goldmines.  


6) I disagree allowing anybody to use our Parliament to clear his/her name instead of our courts. Parliament and Parliamentary time, resources and Members of Parliament must never be used or misused by anybody for such purposes.  


7) I take Word of Honour seriously and I want the PAP government to equally honour its own Word of Honour given to Singaporeans on the returning of their CPF savings at their 55 birthday seriously. At the very, very least, give people a choice to either op-in or opt-out of their schemes and not simply legislate and conveniently neglected whatever promises made earlier and ""bully"" our citizens.  


8) I don't like it when we are one of the world's top retirement fund savers but so many people after decades of saving find themselves faced with retirement inadequacies and living in a declining value flat with failing health.  


9) I support the Foreign Talent policy but I don't like it when the government has overdone it, taking the easy and lazy way without realising it and resulting in our citizens paying the price for it at the ground level and on a daily basis.  


10) I don't like it when top people or PAP Ministers always get away scot-free when fiascos happened under their charge but the blame always fall on some junior people whether it was the MRT tunnel flooding or fatal accident at Pasir Ris station or train collision at Joo Koon station. Another example would be the Hepatitis C outbreak that killed innocent people at SGH or our military training accident deaths etc....  


11) I don't like it when AMK GRC residents' S&amp;C fees were lost for 2 years and their 6 PAP MPs there could simply continue to behave as if nothing has happened and/or nothing to do with them and continue with their more good years. None resigned in shame or at least, offered to resign.  


12) I don't like it, in fact, I consider it to be an insult when I read that Goh Chok Tong considers those who earn less than S$500,000 annually to be mediocre.  


13) I don't like it when I read that Goh Chok Tong said that PAP Ministars are not paid enough.  


14) I don't like it when I read that Edwin Tong lamented that he has to support his parents-in-law too and that it is tough for him with the political salary that he is earning.  


15) I don't like our Parliament and Cabinet being made up of only book-smart people and people with impeccable educational credentials. Life is not a straight line and all kinds of people make up our society and country. We are so short of, for example, people who fail in businesses but sebsequently make good or succeed in life being represented in Parliament or people who are not highly educated and struggle a great deal in life but are good, caring and decent Parliamentarians.

18) I don't like seeing the picture of former PAP MP, Penny Low, looking down and fiddling with her handphone during a NDP when our national anthem was being played.   


19) I do not like the policy that 1st generation new citizens need not serve national service. Life anywhere is a matter of give and take and not just take and take and serving national service even in non-combat vocation must be a consideration for all new citizens if they eventually choose to settle here.

SINGAPORE - Home-grown sports retail chain Sportslink wound up last  Friday (July 3) after accumulating debts to a ""substantial number"" of  creditors.

This includes employees who are owed a month's salary, Farooq Mann,  founder and director of Mann &amp; Associates, the court-appointed  liquidator, told The Straits Times.

""I will convene a creditors' meeting within the next two weeks to  notify them that the company has gone into liquidation, to disclose to  them the affairs of the company, and to invite them to file claims,""  said Mr Mann on Monday.

 On June 9, Adidas Singapore had filed an application with the High  Court for the winding up of Sportslink. When contacted before Friday's  decision, Adidas declined to comment.

The news of Sportslink's liquidation comes barely two weeks after it  announced its reopening in a June 22 Facebook post following the easing  of circuit breaker measures on June 19.

The measures, which were implemented to stop the spread of the  coronavirus, saw retail stores across the country shut from April 7.

Founded in 1983 by the late Mr Lim Kau Tee as Sports Interlink, a  single store in Queensway Shopping Centre, the company was registered as  a sole proprietorship four years later with the Accounting and  Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) as Sportslink.

Sports Link Holdings (SLH) was later registered in 1994.

Sportslink, which sold sporting goods and apparel from international  brands, was a hit with heartlanders because of its reasonable pricing.  It extended its reach to suburban malls in 1995 and by 2002, the chain  had expanded its footprint to 11 outlets. This grew to 35 by 2015, by  which time the company also boasted 190 employees.

But in a Facebook post announcing its Chinese New Year operating  hours on Jan 22, only nine outlets, including a factory outlet, were  listed.

In 2010, SLH also opened several speciality stores, such as Hoops  Factory, which was the first basketball speciality store in Singapore.

When ST visited Hoops Factory and Intersports - two brands under  SLH's banner - at Queensway Shopping Centre on Wednesday, both stores  were shuttered.

Stocks of sports apparel were still stacked on shelves, and posters  of sales of up to 50 per cent were plastered on the walls of the  entrances.

Mr Mann noted that all intellectual property assets of SLH such as these are also ""being looked at"".

Former patron Trevor Sim said he used to visit Sportslink outlets  ""quite frequently"" in the 2000s, but less so in the last 10 years.

""It's sad to hear of a local brand going out of business,"" said the 42-year-old executive, who is an avid runner.

 ""Sportslink used to be the go-to when you needed quality sports  equipment at low prices, and at short notice, because they had so many  outlets.""

""I don't know what caused them (to wind up) but perhaps people having  so many more options now, especially online, could have contributed.""",,Sportslink goes out of business,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hnyrhu/sportslink_goes_out_of_business/

i0glrs,1596087907,i0glrs,1,,"Now, before I continue with this opinion, I want to caveat my post with the fact that I do think unreservedly that the OP was in the wrong in this whole debacle. Whatever his intentions, he should indeed have looked for formal help or advice, before publicising the issue on social media with his various political slant on it. However, I want to touch on further issues that go beyond what OP said and what the old lady reportedly told him, because now that the online mob is after him (and in some parts the old lady), I do think in general, Singaporeans could do better in empathising with people who fall through the cracks and with people who deem it fit to bring up these issues.  

Firstly, I find it perplexing that to many people, a single MSF update apparently explains everything. It’s as if this particular truth vindicates the mob in trying to justify how all is good and how people (like OP) are just trying to nitpick problems when there aren’t many in the first place. Based on some of the comments I see, apparently living with her son in a 5 room flat with a helper absolves the old lady from all financial struggles, and being a PR justifies her extremely low part time wage right now, without consideration of other factors like her familial relationships. There is no indication that she is not struggling, or of the exact circumstances surrounding the case, and yet people are treating the case like it’s closed and done, as if they know the full facts of the case itself. Now that MSF has stepped in and clarified her condition, surely all was well in the first place and all is going to be good right?

This particular mindset is not new. We see it all the time when statutory boards gives updates after a certain complain (by certain individuals) goes viral, and people’s first response is to attack these individuals for not going through proper channels (or for lying), without consideration of other factors that may have caused this to happen in the first place. As someone in training to be a social worker, this disheartens me terribly. The first thing we learn from our experience in this sector relates to the reasons why so many people refuse to go for help (or are unaware) and hence fall through the cracks. Some are even ineligible, for various reasons despite their immediate needs. We do a disservice to them if we continually ask them why they fall through these cracks instead of trying to fix these cracks ourselves to reach out to them.

More importantly, there is a tendency for which we afford any official updates from official figures as the divine objective truth with regards to personal struggles when personal struggles (financial or otherwise) tend to be subjective to each person’s lived experience. Just because it looks fine, doesn’t always mean everything is fine in real terms.

There is also a tendency to put down people complaining as having exaggerated/ not telling the full truth/ having an agenda, 
when they are obviously complaining from a place of hurt. This does not justify any embellishment in their stories, but it also does not warrant any hurtful comments or aspersions on their character. Imagine if all social workers acted as what the online mob did, when our first response is to beat down the complainer rather than try to empathise. What good do you think this does for our society and for people who fall through the cracks?

I have even seen disgusting comments suggesting that the old lady could have dementia and is faking/exaggerating her poor living situations for god knows what reasons, and comments describing her act as typical of the older generation today.

Like really? Instead of choosing to be empathetic of whatever struggles she is going through, some of which even MSF have confirmed, there are still people accusing her of having a sinister agenda? 

When I first saw the MSF post, the first thing I tried to do was not to poke holes in the old lady’s original story, but to look at issues that may have exacerbated her worries and ignited such a response from her. Immediately, my attention was turned to the fact that her current wage was cut and that one of her son truly perished in a military accident. I cannot even begin to comprehend the build up grief all these years only to end up in a scenario today where she was unable to keep her rice bowl. My understanding of why perhaps she lashed out the way she did (and complained about government not supporting her) was due to her frustration at having to suffer so much in the past, and still not be able to earn a decent income for herself now. She might have thought that she was set for life after the incident, only to find out that was the not the case. Of course, all these are just conjectures, but I hope we understand why it is always important to approach things from other angles instead of the tired and old trodden narrative of complainers always having an axe to grind or be up to no good in order to discredit the government etc.

Which brings me to my next point. Why is it that when people talk about systemic issues and inequalities the first response is always not about discussing these issues, but attacking the people who publicise these issues. OP is obviously in the wrong here, and for many reasons. But so are all the detractors taking away from the discussion initially steered towards discussing systemic problems in this Covid era, where many people are not receiving adequate help and facing issues like unemployment or pay cuts, with the old lady as one such example.

Have we become so thin skinned that when faced with any accusations of problems(whether singular or plural) in our society we immediately become defensive and insist that all that is needed to be done is to go look for formal help? Even Social Workers will tell you that this is not fool-proof despite all their best efforts and intentions.

Why is it that many Singaporeans internalise that a critique of our system is a critique on themselves? Have we become so blinded by the successes of our meritocratic system that any flaws of it must be vehemently protested and dismissed because it destroys our successful narrative?

I do find value in trying to educate OP on what is the proper and acceptable way to seek help for people who are truly in need of help.

But many of the comments I see (despite being supposedly framed to educate him) 
are just self serving and condescendingly smug. 

Regardless of whether OP was in the right or wrong, how are these comments (as seen from Facebook) acceptable? 

Comments asking him if he meant to help, why only offer the old lady 2 dollars? 

Comments gloating at his Facebook post, asking him if he is satisfied now that the old lady reportedly lost her job?

Comments accusing him of making up everything and just seeking clout.

Comments haranguing him for bringing up the minimum wage and how that would have helped the old lady. Note that I think OP should not have brought up (or attacked) any political parties in particular, but I definitely don’t see how and why a discussion on minimum wage cannot be addressed in this particular issue itself.

None of us know OP well enough, and neither has he got any apparent history in activism or social justice. This is not a person who consistently spouted divisive bullshit or has always posted provocatively (unlike some other regular online commentators). This is a person, who at worst, found it triggering to relate to such an experience due to his own perceived biases, and decided to give his own take and rant on it, albeit in a misguided fashion. With the benefit of hindsight, do you think he will make the same mistake again? Bearing in mind that OP actually went down with a volunteer to discern the facts for himself when he could have hid behind the keyboard  (like the “SJW” he was) and pretended nothing happened?

And yet, by the comments floating around, it would seems as though he is the devil incarnate guilty of being the next useless social justice warrior, with his employment and studies all thrown into disrepute as well as being targeted by character assassinations and smears.

Sure, he sounds opinionated, but is it really fair to attack both the messenger and message in such a manner? Is there absolutely a need for this childish version of discourse, where we one-up certain stories and truths such that everyone can pile on the pressure when the ultimate truth is revealed? Is there absolutely no value we can take away from this discussion about people in need, rather than just assuming everything also MSF/the government will settle?

To me, the end result is telling, when OP is willing to be proven wrong despite the personal cost to him, while his detractors just want to be proven right because that justifies their contempt and disgust at OP for daring to do what he did.

Because tell me, why do we have to make it sound as though somebody won/ the truth prevailed when nobody is the winner here? The old lady has reportedly lost her job, OP is under tremendous heat for not clarifying in the first place, folks from MSF have to work overtime, and everything good from the discussion about systemic problems (some of which are legitimate) has just been thrown out of the window. 

I fear for our discourse when we view complex life struggles in such a black and white fashion. OP was in the wrong for attempting to generalise and internalise his own biases onto a very specific situation. 

Let’s not make the same mistake and sweep away all the good discussion (some of which I saw online regarding systemic problems) just because of one specific situation that we do not have full access to the facts. Let’s continue to be reminded that there are many people in similar plight as the old lady and many more people who fall through the cracks and let’s be more empathetic to their struggles, no matter what channels they may take to vent their frustrations. 

Note: I think I’ve had enough internet for the day. I’m going to take a break from this and come back to this post later at night or tomorrow. So if you comment, I’m sorry if I do not reply you. Still, feel free to discuss among yourselves in a civil manner.

&amp;#x200B;

# NTU

* Safe entry to every school building/foodcourt, but you are free to roam about the common areas
* Most lectures were pushed online with tutorials/labs still conducted in physical classes
* No standing in campus buses (Because COVID-19 only affects those who stand, right?)

**My observations:**

It feels like the week before finals even though we have only started the semester. Students are crowding everywhere from school buildings to common areas for their online lessons. Apparently lectures were shifted online to facilitate ""safe distancing"" and reduce the number of students on campus, but this has backfired for a simple reason - Tutorials and labs are still conducted in person.

Most students have a mix of both online and physical lessons in a single day, with little breaks between them. To illustrate what I mean, imagine you have an online class in the morning followed by a 1 hour break before your physical class starts. If you stay &gt;1 hour away from NTU (which is very common), you have no choice but to camp in school for your online class as you will be late for your physical class if you came from home after the online class. I guess this is the main reason why we see common areas flooded with students at any time of the day.

**NTU has a standing agreement with COVID-19 to not infect students who are sitting down on campus buses**

But NTU should learn from LTA/SBS/SMRT as they have signed a better contract with COVID-19 to not infect anyone on board their transportation mediums, regardless of whether they're standing or sitting.",,"Tertiary students of Singapore, what COVID-19 measures have your school implemented?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ieblo3/tertiary_students_of_singapore_what_covid19/

This is the letter he handwrote to M. Ravi, a prominent human rights lawyer who has taken on other prominent cases involving the death penalty in the past, defending people including Yong Vui Kong and Shanmugam Murugesu.

As kind of expected, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have come out again to condemn the sentencing. 

[Singapore: Halt imminent execution of man convicted of drug-related offence](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/09/singapore-halt-imminent-execution-of-man-convicted-of-drugrelated-offence/)

[Singapore Should Rehabilitate, Not Execute, Drug Users](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/15/singapore-should-rehabilitate-not-execute-drug-users)

While admittedly I'm not like the significant proportion of the Singapore Reddit community that completely oppose the death penalty, I am completely against this particular instance involving Syed Suhail.

The current coronavirus case makes it all the more unfair that he's being executed on such a short notice (8 days, if I remember correctly?). Furthermore, I do feel that his case warrants a commutation of his sentence to be reduced. Even if reduced to life imprisonment, that's already better than getting hanged.

It's not like he's a criminal boss or a big-time drug runner. Also, to put it in a way, in this instance he's a product of the shortcomings of Singapore's systems. I don't think it's right for the country to kill its own citizens because of its own shortcomings.

Local figures like Kirsten Han and Subhas have also taken to social media to raise awareness on the issue, in hopes that Syed Suhail's death sentence will be commuted. Wakeupsingapore (as much as I hate that Instagram page) has also shared some posts relating to the death sentence. 

**Joel Tan (Instagram handle joltahn) has also put up a template to email to your GRC/MP, or even to the PMO and Cabinet ministers, to request for clemency.**

Am close to just giving up and buying a pet. 

Some info about me and spouse: we both live in a 5 room HDB, have had experience with owning dogs, regular office jobs. We know we want a dog to complete our family (no kids for the next few years) and we dont mind getting an SS and giving a stray a home so I have been reaching out to various shelters in singapore to enquire about adoption, as well as browse their website for dog profiles. 

Most shelters take weeks to reply, if they even do at all. And it is usually to tell me the dog i am interested in is already adopted. They're not open to having people visit the shelter to view dogs unless the visitor already has a specific dog in mind. Maybe this is due to Covid? Fair enough then. 

Those that don't reply at all though.. I'm not really sure why? You'd think they'd be happy that people are keen to have a look at their dogs, and potentially give them a home. Btw to be clear, im not one of those who demands for a puppy or young dogs etc. We're actually open to dogs as old as 8 or 9 years old. 

One volunteer from SOSD whatsapped me after I've submitted their adoption form. However the first question she asked was whether we had window grilles at home. I said no, and she said then we cannot adopt from SOSD, because they are strict on this. Which, ok fair enough, no hard feelings. 

The WORST experience I had was with this other well-known shelter. I got a volunteers' number from a friend who adopted from that shelter through this volunteer, let's call her C. 

Everything was fine at the start, C got me to fill out the form, then we had a phone interview where she asked more indepth questions, like what sort of jobs do we do, what our living arrangements are like, what were our experiences with dogs etc. Then she arranged an appointment for us to go down to the shelter to interact and view dogs. This appointment was postponed due to double booking on their end, but it's cool, things happen. At least we have scored a visit to a shelter after hitting dead ends with other shelters! Some progress at long last. 

A different volunteer, let's call her A, showed us around the shelter and introduced us to the different dogs. At one point she was kind of asking us to adopt a pair of siblings (10year olds) so they could keep each other company while we were both at work. A had asked us what our working hours are like, which was 9 to 6, plus travel time, would mean that the dogs would be left alone for 11 hours on weekdays. We're now WFH indefinitely but i understand they want to be prepared for the future also. 

Anyway, we were not keen on getting 2 dogs at a go. So we continued down the rows of dogs, most of them were elderly dogs, 8 to 10 years old. A told us we are not suitable to keep young dogs, not even those that are 5 years old because they would be too bored at home. We were like oh ok then fair enough, afterall she was the expert, and we are ok with the older ones. 

So we viewed quite a lot more dogs and when we were done with the tour, A told us that we might not be suitable to adopt any dogs from this shelter due to our working hours. She said maybe their shelter is strict, so maybe we could check out other shelters. I didnt really understand what she was trying to say, so i asked if i should talk to C first then, to see what to do next? She said yes. In hindsight, she was already trying to reject us at that point... 

So we left and we had a discussion on the wonderful dogs we met. In particular, one 9 year old dog has found its way into our hearts. So i texted C, told her we were keen on that dog, and asked what the next step would be? 

She replied a day later, saying that the committee discussed and they were uncomfortable with the dogs being left alone for so long. Hence they wont be able to let us adopt any. 

I was baffled and furious. Everything about us was communicated even before the visit to C, including our working hours. If they had such a rule, why make us go down in the first place, and waste our time and A's time? 

Moreover, this excuse about our working hours alwas complete nonsense, because my friend adopted from them and she and her spouse definitely worked too? An acquaintence I spoke to also adopted a dog from them, he was single, lived alone, and a first time dog owner, and yes, worked office hours too. 

I don't understand what went wrong but I didn't want to pursue the matter with the shelter, because what's the point? What use would it be if i called them out on their inconsistencies? I wouldn't want to go down any further with the adoption process with this shelter if this was how they ran things anyway. 

I understand shelters have strict policies to prevent their rescues from going through unnecessary suffering. But this seems a little too much. How many Singaporeans work office hours, live in HDBs with no maids, and no retired parents to help care for the dog in the day? 

This whole attempt at adoption has left a very bad taste in my mouth, and I am sorely tempted to just buy a dog. I feel triggered now, when I see people constantly chanting ""adopt, dont shop"" as if it were that easy. 

Do share your experiences with me if you have any, whether as a volunteer or a fosterer or an adopter.",,Pet adoption is surprisingly difficult in Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jq6xfr/pet_adoption_is_surprisingly_difficult_in/
jg47rr,1603387821,jg47rr,2,1,"Hi guy, recently I have helped and guided a friend of mine in applying for a few financial aid schemes such as the SGUS Skillfuture and COVID relive aid as she is not technologically savvy and is did not do well in her education unfortunately. To be honest, the process of applying for financial aid is such a hassle and to be honest quite difficult even for someone studying economics in university. Following are the reasons why I say that it is quite difficult.

[Procurement of information]
At first the information asked started off fairly simple and straightforward such as, provide her monthly income along with a prove of an income statement. Things start to get difficult when they asked for her CPF contributions, detailed information of her insurance status, family income, assets, etc. Some of these information are not easy to obtain and it’s even harder if someone is attempting to apply on their own.

[Confusing language]
As I read through questions and instructions I found it quite frustrating as I have to constantly Google meanings of words due to huge jargons and arcane instructions. Imagine someone who isn’t good in English, it would be a nightmare for them.

In the end, some might give up and continue to suffer without aid. To be honest, I have a simple solution to propose, as long u knows someone’s income u know if they need aid. Or maybe it’s a tactic to deter too many people to apply?

Parents are alarmed as their sons are forced to screen sickly passengers without adequate protection, despite the government's claim that Singapore's health system is well-prepared for the coronavirus outbreak.

The government has claimed that Singapore has been preparing for another outbreak of a similar scale after SARS and has started collaborating with Raffles Medical to conduct health screening. ""I think we are better prepared now"", the prime minister reportedly said, during a WEF meeting.

The administration so far has advised citizens not to procure N95 masks for personal use and refrain from wearing surgical masks in the public if they are healthy, as Singapore masks supply dwindled and prices surged.

According to an unnamed source, as the ministry is unable to recruit sufficient healthcare assistants, NSFs from the 41th Singapore Artillery Regiment and other units have been ""volunteered"" in enhanced temperature screening operations beginning tonight. Servicemen will be stationed at airport checkpoints and aerobridges to record temperatures for passengers for all inbound flights, particularly Chinese citizens wearing surgical masks. 

Servicemen are expected to escort sickly passengers to quarantine without protective gowns or N95 masks. ""This is the army"", a regular officer said in an internal briefing, ""we have to do this to ... protect our border health.""

The coronavirus from Wuhan, known as 2019-nCoV, has infected thousands and spread to dozens of countries. So far it has claimed a hundred lives in China and has no known cure. More alarmingly, some infected patients are asymptomatic during its incubation period, putting even well-trained healthcare professionals at risk. ""Putting the lives of ill-trained, ill-equipped, non-professional and forcefully conscripted personnel on the line"", critics noted, ""is a breach of every known code in disease control.""

Heres what i found from a straits times article
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/current-estimate-is-20-of-wuhan-virus-patients-will-become-severely-ill-says

Q: WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE WUHAN VIRUS?

A: The common symptoms include fever, cough, in more severe cases, shortness of breath, especially when there is pneumonia. Occasionally some symptoms may be absent, for example fever.

Q: HOW DO I KNOW IF THE COUGHING, FEVER AND OTHER RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS THAT I HAVE IS THE COMMON COLD, FLU, DENGUE OR THE WUHAN VIRUS?

A: It is not possible to distinguish clearly between the common cold, influenza and the 2019-novel coronavirus.

Even influenza, which is more common, can lead to severe disease and pneumonia. It also causes death.
However, unlike in Wuhan, there is currently no widespread community transmission in Singapore.
Hence, we would be concerned about a possible 2019-novel coronavirus infection only if one has travelled to China or if one has been in contact with a known case of the infection.
As for dengue, respiratory symptoms are less common and fever, rash, muscle aches and headaches are more common.

Do lmk if theres anything i fact-checked wrong or anything else you've managed to fact-check!


Here's the fake news post i saw:
&gt; Hopefully this is useful and may even keep you safe:

&gt; Dr. Yuen Kwok Yung, a highly respected doctor during the previous SARS period gave the following advice in a speech yesterday.
&gt; 袁國勇醫生，當年香港沙士的抗疫英雄，昨日對於最近的武漢肺炎，作出以下建議：

&gt; 1. He suggests we should try to avoid going to China during this period of time.
&gt; 他建議不要去高危地區。

&gt; 2. If going on a flight, make sure you wear a mask.
&gt; 如果坐飛機（火車）一定要帶口罩.

&gt; 3. Always have antiseptic cleanser or towel readily available.
&gt;（隨身攜帶消毒噴霧，消毒濕纸巾）

&gt; 4. The virus “Coronavirus” is similar type of virus like the previous SARS or MERS. This time it is OC43. There is still no known method of tackling this virus.
&gt; （這種新冠狀病毒，類似沙士，現階段没有治療及對付方法。）

&gt; 5. If you have to go to the market, make sure you wear a mask. Be very vigilant.
&gt; (去菜市場必須帶口罩，必須要非常非常警惕！)

&gt; 6. Health Authority announced that this virus is very serious. （香港衛生署發佈，這個新病毒非常強） However,  as the virus is found to be able to enter your body if your throat or throat mucous is dry, （而且這種病毒被發現如果你的喉嚨很乾，或者喉嚨黏膜很乾，就會較容易進入體內） the one precaution they suggest which can be taken is to ensure your throat or throat mucous is always in a moist condition. （所以保持喉嚨濕潤，是預防的一個方法）In fact, they suggest not to allow your throat to become dry, as in 10 minutes of being dry, the virus will find ways to enter into your body. （只要你的喉嚨乾涸超過10分鐘，這個病毒就會找到入口，入侵身體）So do not refrain from drinking water, always have a bottle handy. （所以千萬記得要喝水）
&gt; For adults, they suggest drinking 50-80cc of warm water; for children 30-50cc. Just drink if you feel your throat is dry. Do not hesitate.（每當口渴，不要猶豫，馬上喝水，大人每口喝50-80cc，小孩每口喝30-50cc） However drinking more than the amount recommended is not necessary, as it will just want to pass through your system. The idea is to “Keep your Throat Constantly Moist”
&gt; （也不需要喝過量的水，目的只是要保持喉嚨濕潤。）

&gt; 7. Before end of March, try not to enter crowded places, MTR or public Transport, and wear a mask if necessary.
&gt;（在3月底之前，避免去人多擠逼的地方，例如地鐵，公共交通。如果要去，必須帶口罩。）

&gt;8. Avoid eating too much deep fried food and take plenty of Vitamen C.
&gt;（不要吃油炸的食物，吃大量的維他命C）

&gt; 9. Control Centre advice on symptoms of this virus: (病徵) 
&gt; - fast and high fever, hard to lower, but if successful, the fever will return very soon.
&gt; （持續高燒不退，就算退了，很快又再燒。）
&gt; - next stage is coughing, in long duration, people affected are mainly children.
&gt; （下一步是長期咳嗽，小孩是高危感染人群。）
&gt; - Adults has mainly throat symptoms, together with headaches and physical discomforts.
&gt; （大人主要是喉嚨痛，頭疼，和渾身不舒服。）
&gt; - the virus is “highly” contagious.
&gt; (這個病毒具高度傳染性。) 
&gt; - elderly and young children are most susceptible, so take super precaution.
&gt; （老人小孩是高危受害群，需要特别注意。）

&gt; I am afraid this is best I know how in translating for my dear friends and family’s benefits. Good health to everyone.
&gt; （這是我對家人朋友可以做到最好的方式，以確保各人健康平安！）For your safety, Godwilling.",,Fake News: Seen on FB,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/evevnx/fake_news_seen_on_fb/
eveyhy,1580258848,eveyhy,2,," (Thought this was interesting and fairly relevant/topical):

The 1918 influenza pandemic hit every country on Earth – well, almost every country. It missed American Samoa entirely, which is interesting.  It’s even more interesting when you notice that it hit the neighboring islands of West Samoa harder than anywhere else.

Worldwide,  the Spanish Flu killed 3-5% of the population – lower in most developed countries, which had better supportive therapy.  Medicos had no useful vaccines or  antiviral agents: in fact they mistakenly thought it was caused by a bacterium. Doctors were useless, but nurses were not.

In the South Pacific, the flu was spread by the SS Talune, which regularly visited Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa, and West Samoa.  Crewmen had picked up the flu in New Zealand and spread it to those ports, excepting American Samoa.

The islands of Western Samoa were administered by New Zealand, which had recently seized them from Germany. The administrator (Colonel Robert Logan) had little administrative experience (former sheep farmer) – he felt that he needed approval from Wellington for any action and he received no instructions.  Medical officers also waited for instructions – none came. In addition, plantation interests were important, and they opposed any quarantine, which was also the case in Fiji. So, no quarantine. Thing went very badly: so many were sick (\~90% of the population)  that few were left to care for them. Since food was mostly in gardens, rather in cupboards,  people starved while weak.  Europeans were less vulnerable, and those that could helped, but there were relatively few in Western Samoa.  20-25% of the population died, concentrated among young adults, the highest death rate in the world.

American Samoa was physically quite close to Western Samoa, less than 100km. There were close cultural ties: people intermarried and often sailed back and forth.  But the governmental structure was different.  There were no copra plantations in American Samoa, so you didn’t have any powerful business interests lobbying for suicide.  The US Navy ran the colony.  John Martin Poyer, an officer that had retired from active duty due to illness, was brought back to active duty in 1915 to serve as Governor of American Samoa.

Both American Samoa and West Samoa had advance warning of the flu’s danger: they both had wireless sets and occasional mail.

Washington didn’t micro-manage American Samoa, not being all that interested.  A policy of benign neglect was interpreted by Poyer as an opportunity to ***act*** on his best judgment***,*** in the finest traditions of the US Navy.  He imposed quarantine. That was harder that it sounds, because of the frequent family visits between West Samoa and American Samoa – but Poyer also had  the support of the local  chiefs, who understood how serious imported epidemics could be.  The people of American Samoa self-blockaded, on top of official quarantine: they sent out canoes to stop any and all visitors.  **They never had a single case.**

Of course there was a disaster.  Some people will think that it occurred in West Samoa. Others will think that the real disaster was in American Samoa.

SINGAPORE: All work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will have to obtain approval from Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they enter Singapore. 

This is regardless of nationality and applies to both existing work pass holders currently out of Singapore as well as In-Principle Approval (IPA) holders who have yet to enter Singapore, said MOM in a press release on Friday (7 Feb).

 Employers are responsible for seeking approval from MOM and should inform their workers not to make travel plans to Singapore until approval is given, said MOM. 

Employers will be required to send the MOM approval letter to their employees, who will then have to produce it at the ICA checkpoint when they arrive in Singapore.

 Employers must apply for approval through an [MOM online form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e3cbabee41f590012014e91) three days before the intended arrival date of their employees.

This will apply to all workers planning to enter or return to Singapore from Feb 9.

""This will enable the entry (and) return of work pass holders to be carried out in an orderly and well- managed way,"" said MOM of the new stipulation.

On Thursday (Feb 6), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced that it will be [mandatory for all workers](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-leave-absence-financial-support-staff-loa-12401360) returning from mainland China to be placed on a 14-day leave of absence (LOA), as Singapore steps up measures to contain the coronavirus situation.

Dependents of work pass holders are also subject to the same requirements. 

After getting MOM's approval, employers will have to declare to the ministry that they have arranged for suitable premises to house returning employees for the duration of their LOA. 

They must either obtain the worker’s landlord’s confirmation, book a hotel room or secure a dormitory room for the worker, MOM said.

Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, employers are responsible for the workers’ accommodation. Those who need help housing their employees can contact MOM at 1800 333 9999 or mom\_qops@mom.gov.sg.

To make sure that workers keep to their LOA, MOM said it will revoke the work pass of the employee and take measures against the employer if the authorities find that the employee breached the LOA requirements.

Members of the public can also report to MOM if they find someone flouting the LOA requirements via mom\_qops@mom.gov.sg or 6438 5122.

According to the Ministry of Health’s guidelines, people on LOA must keep to rules such maintaining a record of people they have came in close contact with during the LOA leave of absence, and minimise time spent in public spaces.",,All workers with travel history to China must seek approval before entering Singapore: MOM,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f09v7l/all_workers_with_travel_history_to_china_must/

Instead, he will distribute and pack meals for other drivers, calling along 2 wuhan brothers to help out. Last day went by and nobody knows what happened to him after that.

It began real slow, then started to spread
First the virus, and then the dread.
Cough, fever, sore throat too,
This is not your typical flu,
Rocky new grounds, with trepidation we tread.

First in Wuhan, and then the rest,
healthcare systems straining at the test.
Irrationality causing global xenophobia,
blaming others is mental myopia.
Nations on tilt, not really acting its best

Corona means crown but this is no king,
“Dethrone this imposter” I hear you sing.
Healthcare workers, bearing the brunt,
Onward soldiers! An inspiring hunt,
There ain’t no cure, just gotta ride out this thing.

When you see the stories of coronavirus
People look at masks and go “i’m gonna buy this”
From yellow to orange the DORSCON goes
the stampede comes, with throngs of woes
The selfish mentality needs to be put on hiatus.

Here’s some advice: the best medicine isn’t laughing,
Wash your hands, use masks when coughing
Please verify stories before you share,
Fake news and annecdotes can really cause a scare.
And for goodness sake, stop up-selling and hoarding!",,Livin la Covida Loca,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f6t7sh/livin_la_covida_loca/

Knowledge IS power and there is so much misinformation out there! Don't just believe what you heard months ago from the media, friends or relatives. Read actively, reflect and ask questions as we find out new things about the virus everyday. 

Hopefully you will realise that we are dealing with a very potent and invisible enemy. We must not fear excessively, but just enough to make good decisions. Hoarding is not the answer, neither is blaming or name calling. This virus does not discriminate between our age, gender, race, religion, economic background. Any one of us can potentially be infected right now and not know until much later, after we have infected many people.

It is in such hard circumstances that our true natures as individuals and as a nation will show. Let us stay united and show our concern for one another. Stay safe and take care, everyone!

/* - must have made a mistake somewhere as there should only be 139 unlinked components of size 1, as these are simply local unlinked cases.

Summary:

As of 2'nd April, there are 187 components for which we cannot link to an imported case. If we use MOH's local unlinked cases of 139, only 48 components are not accounted for. In other words, only around 25% of local cases which cannot be linked to an imported case become subsumed under ""local linked"".

In fact, some time have passed from the local unlinked casess, so the actual numbers of concern would be lesser. And we also know this by MOH's latest press releaase (2'nd April), which states that ""Contact tracing is underway for 118 locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.""

It took an embarrassingly long time to compile the data, even though what I did was relatively brain dead most of the time. It does require a lot of attention though. I can imagine how much more effort is required to perform the contact tracing and investigations. I suppose that the effort scales linearly with the number of cases, but if the number of cases grows exponentially, then the effort required is going to increase exponentially as well, which is not something you can sustainably throw fresh untrained humans in to solve before hitting a bottleneck. 

In other words, contact tracing is really effective at keeping us in the containment phase. But if we do not play our part to try keep the numbers down, it'll become impossible to contact trace and the DORSCON Pantone Chart will run out of orange. So please please please, be as socially responsible as possible.

TL;DR: it's OK to rely on MOH's data directly without additional processing to get a relatively accurate picture of the situation. Please practice social responsibility too.",,Spent some time with the MOH press release data.

fwhuf1,1586253509,fwhuf1,2,,"   Ok, so disclaimer first, what I say may just be an isolated incident or something but still...

   Anyways, I am also a teenager in JC and I have been borderlined irritated and annoyed with the way fellow schoolmates are treating COVID.  It is true that the MOE actually does ensure measures and put in place in schools and I think that is great. But they do not work!! SIMPLY BECAUSE MOST TEENAGERS DO NOT CARE!

   For example, there was a rule saying X amount of people can be in 1 lift at a time. But during rush periods guess what? THE LIFT WAS FILLED TO THE BRIM. Only when a teacher appears, do people adhear to the rule. And as to the crosses placed on alternate benches, they are literally as good as transparent to most as people blatently cramp at a table just to talk! Not only, one could hardly tell that half the world was getting ravaged from a pandemic looking at the attitudes of my schoolmates. There was even people making jokes of the whole situation, is it really funny that people are dying??

   What was the worst I have seen is that since today was the last day of school before HBL, many people thought it was cool to take class picture or hang out 1 last time. HELLO, I KNOW YOU STUDY BISHAN BUT GOT BRAIN ANOT? You take class picture of clearly more than 10 ppl and all hugging each other not sick also confirm sick. The point of this 2 days was not to have a last blast but to make sure you prepared for HBL and instead you huddle with 30 other people?? There are so many more instances of this from queueing less than 1m at canteen to switching assigned seats in class.

   Hence I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE to the idea of school closure as it can stop such irresponsible people from getting everyone else sick (seriously? a class photo over your grandpas health??). Also,with entertainment closed, I am praying hard that it reduces the number of irresponsible teenagers who decide to meet physically during this time.

  So please please please, for my sake and your sake and everyones sake, please take this seriously and SOCIAL DISTANCE! If you have the means, I think everyone will appreciate it if you can wear a mask as often as possible (reusable mask better than no mask), as it protects you and everyone nearby. The measures in place are only as effective as our attitudes.

I am part of  small Singaporean startup doing cooking and groceries and we know that it's the best timing to start cooking at home right now. But we noticed that grocers can't offer next day delivery, nor guidance to the people willing to learn cooking with what they buy. We also know the struggle of business owners, SMEs.  
I'd like to share a new idea that a few of our friends in the food and logistics space have put together within 1 week. 👉🏻 Stay-At-Home Grocery Basket

It comes with ingredients + recipes and free next day delivery. It's very convenient to just place an order and cook as we already planned the meals.  


We started working on it after hearing that it’s really tough to get grocery delivery slots with online grocers and at the same time, many local businesses like restaurant, wholesaler, and travel agency have taken a big blow in their business due to COVID-19, so we teamed up with SMEs to help them cut loss and raise awareness for their businesses to get through these challenging times together!

Each basket contains over 20 types of high quality ingredients: fresh vegetables and mushrooms as well as 2 large pcs of fresh Barramundi fillets and 1 Salmon fillet (boneless, kid-friendly).

You can confidently whip up 4 meals for 2-3 pax with the recipes and have extra ingredients for your own creation.

We are looking for new partners such as logistic providers, grab, taxi, gojek drivers as well as chefs and restaurant owners. Feel free to DM me if you want to be part or know anyone in the space!

As a frequent lurker on r/aww, I saw an uptick in videos showing people with their newly bought/adopted pets. As much as it is heartwarming to see people enjoying time with their pets, I can't help but think that we are as important to pets as they are to us. To us, they may be a source for companionship and comfort during times like this. But to them, we're potentially their lifetime and hopefully, a good time.

Granted, some (or maybe majority) of these videos could be dated and did not actually happen during this time period, I still want to emphasise the fact that taking care of a pet is a huge commitment. There's no hiding that. You are raising a living being and not an object.

It hurts seeing pets being abandoned when they should be enjoying their lives. So please, think twice, thrice and even more, before taking up this commitment.

g3j29d,1587191931,g3j29d,2,,"I made a comment on this sub last week about a former Stanford professor who analyzed the CoronaVirus numbers and suggested the mortality rates were probably much lower were almost certainly ""...closer to .1%"" than what was being discussed. The replies to my comment were enthusiastically negative. I was called ""a Facebook Karen' and roundly downvoted. Filling in some details, the former Stanford professor is Dr Doug Lisle, an Evolutionary Psychologist. He does a podcast with Dr Jen Howk (Political Science from Harvard). The weekly podcast is called ""Beat Your Genes"" and it's my favorite podcast. I recommend it. 

They usually discuss ""How to find happiness in the modern world"" through the lens of Evo Psy, but for the last 5 episodes they have exclusively discussed the CoronaVirus crisis. Or more to the point, how to think about what it means for you and those close to you. On the most recent episode (#217) he goes over some data from 7 countries. He gets numbers from [www.worldometer.com](http://www.worldometer.com/) and if I recall correctly also used to teach statistics at Stanford. 

[https://www.blogtalkradio.com/beatyourgenes](https://www.blogtalkradio.com/beatyourgenes)  


I listen to the podcast because their analysis is intelligent. Lisle says the data from the 7 countries presents nice bell curves indicating that the crisis is waning in many countries and is almost certainly not as lethal as was originally thought. He places the death rate at .15% - .2%. The outlier was New York, which for some reason has higher death rates than everyone else. One possible factor (my thought) is that hospitals are being ordered to ascribe deaths to the CoronaVirus if they are unsure of cause of death. ""Gotham’s Health Department abruptly added 3,700 victims to the COVID-19 death toll *even though these decedents were not tested*.""  
[https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-problem-with-new-york-citys-covid-19-death-rate-estimates/](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-problem-with-new-york-citys-covid-19-death-rate-estimates/)

I posted my comment not to upset anyone. I thought I was presenting some good news because I hear people throwing around numbers like 'a 1% death rate'. The University of Washington is now using a model with a death rate of .15% and are predicting far fewer deaths. Here's a post from today's Science sub suggesting far more persons are infected, yet the morality is much lower.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/g3eaoj/stanford\_study\_shows\_covid19\_seroprevalence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/g3eaoj/stanford_study_shows_covid19_seroprevalence/)

We should all view this as good news as there is far too much fear mongering out there. And too much outright stupid analysis. Dr Ben Carson, a Trump cabinet member recently made the comment that ""If you get the virus you shouldn't worry too much, as you have a 98% chance of survival"". The guy is a brain surgeon and he's off by an entire order of magnitude. 

Going to bed now. I was supposed to be back in Singapore now but I was working in the US and got stuck here (my SIA flight back was cancelled).

Singaporeans: hold up, a full-fledged campaign seems a little unnecessary. Coulda been done as a one-time tongue-in-cheek post, you know? Also credit? 

Govt: oh yeah. They're called Band of Doodlers

Singaporeans: cool. Also it's probably not a great idea to name your Indian protagonist Darshita and have her flushed down the toilet as part of her backstory

Govt: wait it's an actual name though

Singaporeans: no, no, it is, but there's a long history of Indians in Singapore being discriminated against for having names that sound remotely peculiar so the association with ""shit"", even if purely coincidental, is unfortunate

Govt: oh. That's fair

Singaporeans: also while trauma like that could induce PTSD, it's also a gross mischaracterisation of obsessive-compulsive disorder... Like how autism is portrayed as a superpower in movies you know? That's just straight up wrong

Govt: we've taken all your suggestions into account and will review accordingly.

Singaporeans: ... maybe try a focus group first? With actual minorities and sci-comm specialists, that'd be good

Govt: ok, give us a week then.

Singaporeans: while you're at it you should probably remove any form of humour, especially if satirical or subversive. As a country we have zero concept of subtlety whatsoever and football fans will be way too butthurt

Braces are not cheap, and you should always make it for every monthly appointment if you want them off faster.
One day before my April appointment, (cb was already in place) the govt revised the guidelines so the clinic i go to which was supposedly able to operate, had to close. After extension of circuit breaker, once again they are not included in the guidelines, so my session went from april to may to june (might get extended even longer)
I know most people wear their braces for a few years and such but I really want to get them off as soon as possible and have never missed an appointment before. Since payment is by instalments, i might need to pay more for it since i’d be delaying the process and thus increasing the number of months i have to go.

gm1vkp,1589810069,gm1vkp,2,,"I posted this here about an hour ago but deleted it within 10 minutes of posting because I found it difficult to share something that made me feel so vulnerable and exposed. But then I started receiving these amazing DMs from people sharing their stories and telling me what they'd been through and what had helped them. It made me realise then that there are many of us out there with similar stories, with some who are still in the midst of it all, and others who’ve overcome their challenges. I’m posting this here again because reading all your stories was incredibly helpful for me, and I hope it'll help others who might be in a similar situation right now. I want to hear your story. If you were ever a NEET, even for a short period, what’s your story?

My story is simple. I’m 23 y.o. and haven't worked in about 4 years. This hasn't been due to laziness, but due to issues that I haven't been able to overcome. 

My confidence regarding working and functioning are a result of a father who was overly-critical and perfectionistic. He works at the SAF and brought that same sort of mentality home. He would shout, berate and shame me if things weren't done his way. Everything had to be done perfectly. His words would drip with condescension when he spoke to me. Even something as simple as washing the dishes could get him riled up. 

As a result, I developed a huge fear of failure and a fear of making mistakes. I believe that I'm stupid, unworthy and just not good enough. I have no faith in my abilities, even simple abilities like being able to understand concepts is problematic for me. These seem like basic fears that most people struggle with to some degree, but unfortunately for me, they have become debilitating and have affected every part of my life. 

I survived in school as far as grades were concerned, but only because I could go home and study on my own. I had a difficult time with anything that required me to use my hands, like science experiments, or my brain, like being tested on the spot. I still remember how we had to do practicals every Thursdays in JC. I would lie in bed awake the night before, unable to sleep, and sick with worry. During the experiments, I would be so nervous that my hands would be trembling throughout the lesson. 

This extended to the non-academic side of things as well. I vividly remember an instance where my teacher asked me to count some money, I was so flustered, my heart was pounding and my hands were trembling. I did not even trust myself to do something as simple as count money! 

I spent all my schooling years severely depressed. I had grown up in a dysfunctional family. There was a lot of crap like alcoholism; caning that was so severe that my legs would be completely covered in welts and I would go to school with my socks pulled up to my knees; suicidal and mentally ill parents; one parent whose primary method of discipline was to hold a knife to a neck and threaten to kill me. It was an unstable environment, which eventually culminated in my developing several mental illnesses. 

I continued with school for as long as I could. About 4 years ago, I dropped out of JC without completing my A levels. I couldn't do it anymore. I was suicidal, depressed, and couldn't focus in the slightest. Since then, I haven't worked either. I'm a NEET. I have tried going back to school twice since but dropped out after a short period each time. I very clearly have issues and am in therapy trying to work through them. 

I’ve been in psychiatric treatment for quite a while and my interaction with my psychiatrist is what motivated me to make this post initially. It guess it was a way to get what happened with her off my chest. A couple of days ago, I saw my psychiatrist, who commented that I’m depressed because I haven’t worked in years. She called it a chicken or egg situation. 

Her comments broke me. Not being able to work can indeed lead to depression. The CB and lockdown is hard for people for many different reasons, but this is one of the reasons for some. Calling it a chicken or egg situation would have been a completely reasonable response had it come from someone who'd just met me and doesn’t know my history. 

But this a doctor I've worked with for years and years. She knows that I became depressed as a child. I was depressed even while I was in school and busy. And all the times I went back to school after a period of inactivity, I STILL remained depressed. This is someone who should know my depression is not caused nor significantly worsened by inactivity. Mildly worsened, yes; significantly worsened, no. 

Telling me that it’s my employment that is the cause of my depression also invalidates all my experiences. It's almost as though she was telling me that what I went through wasn't enough to cause depression, and that the only reason I'm depressed is because I'm unemployed. Basically, I’m this dysfunctional and in this much pain, and it's all my doing. If I had only worked, I would never have been in this situation. 

I feel blamed. It would have been fine if she had said that unemployment worsens depression, which it does to some extent. But calling it a chicken or egg situation tore me into pieces. For anyone who's ever been through trauma of any sort, you would know that one of the things that go through your mind is, ""it wasn't bad enough. I’m just overreacting”. We invalidate ourselves, but to be invalidated by a professional who's supposed to understand can feel devastating.

At the end of the session, she added that their goal is to make me functional. I broke down the minute I left her room . 

I feel sad and broken today, and so terribly triggered. The worst part is that I don’t think my doctor meant to hurt me. I think she really believes that my depression is caused by unemployment. If my doctor doesn’t understand the far-reaching consequences of childhood trauma and thinks it’s simple unemployment that’s causing my depression, what chance do I have with others?

Every Chinese new year, I get the same questions and same looks when people realise I'm not working or studying. I know that people view our worth based on how productive we are. But all that does is fill us with shame and make us feel even more useless, and quite often, even more helpless. As someone who was raised to be ultra productive all the time, when I first dropped out school, I would starve myself because I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. I felt like I didn't even deserve to live because I was no longer a productive member of society. 

Let me emphasise this though: I do believe that staying busy is important for our mental health. I still exercise, try to meet people when I can muster the strength to, I try to eat properly, I get sunlight. I would like to work, and I would've done so if I could. Even though it doesn't help with depression in my case, it still gives me a sense of purpose for each day. I’m also in therapy trying to work on those very issues. Yes, I realise that exposure therapy — exposing myself to my fears — will help. I know I can’t hide forever. I don’t want to hide forever. But right now, I am still struggling and I wish I could explain to people the helplessness I feel when trying to explain why I've been unable to work so far. I wish I could explain that I can’t just pull myself up by my bootstraps, and the conventional advice of staying busy, exercising and eating healthy, though useful, doesn’t have a significant effect on depression that’s caused by deep rooted issues. 

Being functional is important, it can be a starting goal, but it certainly can't be an end goal. Being functional doesn't equate to being mentally healthy. I WAS functional while I was in school. 

More than anything though, what I really needed from those treating me and those around me was understanding and acceptance. Understanding that I want to get better and I’m trying. I really am trying.",,From the perspective of a NEET,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gm1vkp/from_the_perspective_of_a_neet/

To start off, I'm not an NUS student (I hope you can post this anyway, admins!) and my family has been hit by this pandemic. Unbelievably hard. My dad and I took on jobs as GrabFood drivers because both my parents lost their jobs. We are part of the corner of society who've had to subsist on maggie mee and canned food this circuit breaker. What follows might be a bunch of small gestures to most, but the kindness here has been overwhelming to me.

It would start with this unknown family receiving a family's worth of free meals from you.

We'd previously heard stories of kind souls ordering extra meals &amp; drinks to belanjah us delivery folk. We'd think how amazing it would be if we could get one too! Early this month, my dad received an order of about $150 to MOH, with about $50 being extra gongcha and set meals (From the restaurant gongcha is partnering with, so it was really no small sum) with a thank you note wishing drivers and their families well. My dad was even more surprised to see later it was a student in his low 20s at most

Later in the night, my dad reached out to this boy to thank him for this gesture and shared why it meant so much, with all our mouths to feed at home and me being one of 3 siblings struggling with A levels. Immediately he asked my dad if he could help us in any way and offered us his own materials and tutoring (We later found out he runs a free online tutoring service for jc students!)

When my dad shared this story in his many whatsapp chats, we found out from a cousin who is also working part time at MOH that this student, currently going on to year 3, is leading almost 100   
other students to support MOH efforts in fighting this war. Even there he is known for helping and treating his colleagues, with one time even treating his whole office

To Mr Lee (I know you won't want your name known), thank you and all your colleagues for fighting covid for us. I can't believe how tired you may be working shifts and still making time to help my siblings &amp; I till 3am and beyond on your rest days. I find it amazing how you are willing to use your whole summer to help Singapore in this time and use even your off days to help us folk 

I also know you have a huge heart for people and will be a great doctor

hjqm3r,1593665495,hjqm3r,2,," An excellent summary, posted in LinkedIn by Beatrice Rangel.  


A dear friend who spent her life at the British Foreign Office once told me, ""I have learned to respect and love boring countries. Because they home free and democratic societies.""  


Think of Switzerland; Sweden; New Zealand, Uruguay and Singapore. They seldom make headlines but they are a cradle to peaceful and happy people.  


These thoughts come to mind when panning over the Latin American leadership's public policy deployment in these times of pandemic. Only one nation seems to have struck the right balance between containing the virus and protecting individual freedom.  


And that country of course is Uruguay. The recently inaugurated President Luis Lacalle Pou correctly decided to treat his citizens like well educated adults and refrained from banning any economic, educational or intellectual activity.  


He did take to the microphones to let his people know how serious the health threat was and how important it was to take every possible precaution including wearing masks all the time, washing hands and suspending social gatherings.  


He further supported universal testing and following of infected people and their circle of social exchanges over their past three weeks. This allowed health authorities to establish potential contagion maps and alert infected but asymptomatic people to get treatment. As a result, Uruguay kept 80% of its economy working while the number of infected people was about 800 people with 25 deaths in a nation of 3.5 million inhabitants.  


But the country also prepared itself from the ensuing worldwide recession that will certainly affect export markets by reducing by 20% public expenditures different from payrolls.  


The quality of Uruguay's leadership and the outstanding results of its pandemic control policies drove the Fundación Libertad chaired by Mario Vargas Llosa to issue a communique promoting the regionwide adoption of Uruguay's approach to combating covid19. In particular Fundación Libertad emphasized the contrast between public policies in Uruguay and those adopted by Argentina, which issued home arrest orders to its citizens, increased expenditures and killed economic activity. 

 In a nutshell Argentina created the conditions to develop an economic Tsunami after covid 19 is contained. And this will certainly make headlines. Uruguay on the contrary will most probably carry on unnoticed but its citizens are way happier than those of Argentina.",,How Uruguay Tamed COVID-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hjqm3r/how_uruguay_tamed_covid19/

I have been following the COVID19 news very closely since the outbreak in China and subsequently the potential treatments that are emerging since then. As someone that spends alot of time following this and seeing how much selfishness and greed has somewhat directly resulted in many preventable deaths is really frustrating.

**The first real treatment came from a US Doctor who used  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + Zinc and managed to prevent his 80%+ of his COVID19 patients from being hospitalized and had a case fatality rate of just under 1%. The cocktail was given to patients that he deemed at risk pre-emptively** **(ie given early)****.** Donald Trump spoke to this Doctor and that was when a simple straightforward solution became buried under a campaign of misinformation.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Dr  Zelenko shares his findings on HCQ + Zinc
2. Trump talked about it to the media
3. A few early studies in the US showed HCQ alone given to serious cases did not have any effect. ( Why was this anti-viral cocktail given so late to patients and without Zinc?)
4. Some doctors started warning of HCQ causing heart failure (HCQ never had any such warnings and has been used as anti-malaria drug for decades before COVID19 and this was previously not stated on World Health Organization's\[WHO\] website)
5. Subsequently WHO changed their HCQ recommendation to warn that it can cause Heart failure 
6. Three US doctors published a big data study stating HCQ had no effect on COVID19 patients globally. The scientific paper was published on *The Lancet*, medicine’s most respected scientific journal.  Data was provided by a company called Surgisphere.
7. After this study, WHO suspended all ongoing HCQ related clinical trials.
8. Medical professionals worldwide started questioning the data used in the study. An Australian hospital claimed to not have given any one their data and another hospital claimed the numbers are incorrect. Questions also arise on how Surgisphere managed to get the data from Africa where experts working there knew records are mostly paperwork and difficult to obtain.
9. Investigation was conducted and Surgisphere refuses to release the raw data used in the study
10. The Lancet retracts the scientific paper.
11. **New studies are beginning to emerge, the latest showing a 13% reduction in death rate when only HCQ is given early.  The study was published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases** 
12. Gilead Science, an american Biotechnology trialed their COVID19 drug Remedsivir in US and in China.  China results showed that the treatment neither improved patients’ condition nor tamped down on the amount of virus in their blood
13. In the US Remedsivir began their phase 3 trial(last hurdle before approval) but their primary objective has been changed after the study started. (talk about changing the drug's primary objective after completing phase 2 with the original objective)
14. Remedsivir approved. Shown to reduce hospitalization by an average of 4 days. No change to case fatality rate. (compare that to HCQ +Zinc above in bold)
15. Gilead Sciences donates Remedsivir.
16. Gilead Sciences prices Remedsivir at  $2,340  per treatment (compare that to HCQ + Zinc at $30)

I hope the above sheds some light on some possible reasons why a safe, cheap and effective cocktail  that is readily available is not being utilized widely now.

Why were the early studies conducted in a way that was different from how Dr Zelenko advised? Why was the Fraudulent Lancet HCQ paper published, was there an agenda behind it? Does the Pharmaceutical industry want to discredit other drugs to boost their own sales? Or is it a political play to make Trump look like a fool before the upcoming US elections for recommending HCQ + Zinc , which he personally takes?

We are planning to meet again.

I'm receiving conflicting information from people regarding what is the next step. Someone told me to date for a couple of months before asking her out, and another told me to basically just ask her about our relationship the next time we meet.

 If we are both interested in each other, does it make it official? Should we go out more often before I explicitly ask if we want to make it official? We haven't discussed anything, so I'm confused regarding what is the situation. Simultaneously, I'm afraid that if I ask her, there's some stress/pressure on her part to give a definite response.

2. Singapore’s extremely low death rate is often attributed to the extremely large number of young patients, a huge majority are these migrant workers.

i had a medical appt with my psychologist today, but i feel like i jus cannot connect with him as he kept saying i was confusing him (so i had to explain to him several times). and in b/w the convo, there will be lots of awkward pauses and he will ask me ""how do u feel abt it"" or ""what do u think abt it"" when honestly ive said what i needed to say...sometimes i ponder if im the one who has a problem b/c i have ady switched psychologist once...so shd i change to another one? altho it has only been one month w my current psych, i jus felt like we were constantly at diff wavelengths. 

more imptly, he was suggesting me to move out instead (due to the family environment and the other reasons which i mentioned in my reddit post), but the thing is im not financially stable now as my parents prevly quit my retail job w/o my consent. til now, my bosses cant give me a definite answer. but i rly need the income. during this pandemic season, its not easy for me to find another job that is near my location, has flexible timings and offers average pay. due to my health condition, im unable to travel far to work for long hours. so ive been really troubled with finances. as much as im providing home tuition now (fortunately), it definitely isnt enough for me to cover my medical bills and have food in the long run (which is why i only eat 1 meal a day for now). i prevly did a one-time off fundraising, but i felt as if it was so unethical of me to take people's money for me to seek priv mental health treatment, when others prob need it way more than me. initially i received more than required, so i donated it to mental health organisations. but subsequently i got into crisis, so my medical appts became even more frequent. if i drag it, i will lack medical attention. i have switched from hospital to hospital, and now to a priv clinic. im also tired to switch again. reason why i switched from hospital to hospital was bc they said they couldnt rly help me and all would jus refer me to imh (which is rly not what i want). sometimes i rly feel like a burden b/c i rly didnt choose to be like this. i wish i can drag it. but sometimes i jus feel so overwhelmed i cant take it, and my parents wish i can just rely on my willpower and pretend im not feeling depressed/anxious - so that the medical bills wont be so huge (i still try to fund most of it alone). i have siblings too, so all the more im sure its barely enuf for them. and since they are studying, id rather they receive more than i do (due to exp edu fees as well...) and work it out alone... 

as for moving out, for sure i do not feel safe and happy staying at home, but it doesnt seem to be a viable solution for me to move out due to finances and law issues (since im still considered a minor) now. idk what to do from here. please help me. the solutions proposed are easier said than done. idk how long more i can pull through...

f27e4g,1581422603,f27e4g,3,,"Reading about recent attitudes of the Singapore public towards healthcare workers made me think quite a bit about the last pandemic that was sort of serious: SARS-CoV. One story and country stand out: Vietnam. In 2003, Vietnam had [63 cases of SARS and 6 deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322918/) for a population of 82.75 millions in 2003. Currently Vietnam has [15 cases of nCoV](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/coronavirus-vietnams-cases-climb-to-15-baby-infected) for a population of \~98 millions. A few factors were in Vietnam's favour.

\- Less industrialised and urbanised economy.

\- Lower population density in major cities (the majority of people in the larger cities live in town houses, not apartments).

\- Lower reliance on public transport (at the cost of the profusion of motorbikes, urban pollution, and greater likelihood of deaths from garden variety pollution-induced respiratory illnesses).

\- Fewer transit flights from elsewhere; reducing the total number of possible imported cases.

Nevertheless, the quarantine measures that contributed to the success may only be described as ""ruthless"". With SARS, all 63 cases in Vietnam was linked to one patient zero, an American business men who stayed in Hong Kong prior to arriving in Vietnam. He fell sick, was transferred to a private France-Vietnam hospital where a WHO doctor, Carlo Urbani, diagnosed him for SARS. This doctor later contracted SARS and died. Before his eventual passing, Urbani and co. urged Vietnam to close the hospital. Vietnam government basically decided to go to red immediately. Command, control, coordination and information gathering was centralised.

The hospital was closed and most of the staff remained inside. The net effect was: [""The net effect probably was that they gave SARS to each other and not to the outside world""](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/world/sars-epidemic-containment-vietnam-halted-sars-saved-life-nurse.html). The chain of transmission was stopped cold, at the cost of 63 infections, and among them, 6 deaths. The Vietnamese government may be frivolous about many things (like garden variety food poisoning or quality), but not about (so-called) national security threats (not just pandemics, though). (I stole that last line from \[[“The Italians are frivolous about many things,” he told me, “but not about counter-terrorism.”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/edward-luttwak-machiavelli-of-maryland)\]. The success in cutting SARS transmission chain was particularly notable especially when later study showed Vietnamese healthcare workers during SARS [did not used PPE consistently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322918/).

One feature of the mobilisation for quarantine in Vietnam was the immediate mobilisation of the military. The military despite not being ostensibly trained for pandemics control (as well as other disasters) is usually the only organisation with a lot of spare resources, including manpower, specialist knowledge (biological threat defence), logistics, command, control, communication, coordination, transports, food, supplies, organisation, housing, etc ... that is not normally already engaged in the civilian economy; thus representing a strategic reserve often mobilised for things that are not war.

For this nCoV quarantine, for eg:

\- A regimental barrack and headquarter was transformed into a [quarantine centre](https://tuoitre.vn/ben-trong-khu-cach-ly-phong-dich-corona-cua-quan-doi-sat-bien-gioi-viet-trung-20200207093338312.htm) with the regimental troops serving as guards, logistics, supply, security, and health care. The conditions in these centres are frankly, not nice if not Spartan. 

\- At home quarantine are ensured that they remain quarantined by twice daily visits from the local police and healthcare workers.

\- Escapees from one of this quarantine centre sparked nothing less than a manhunt. Photos, pictures, names, copies of ID cards are immediately distributed to local hotels, motels, restaurants, eateries to corner and capture the escapee.

Some of these measures are fairly extreme and certainly not always feasible and they induce a cost in other less chaotic times.",,Ruthless measures of infection control,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f27e4g/ruthless_measures_of_infection_control/

&amp;#x200B;

To restrict all gatherings to less than 10 people and yet still have people go to work/ school is the most hypocritical thing I have heard. We have to be ahead of the virus, not behind it. Keeping offices and schools open when there are other options such as home-based learning is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes there are many families that are unable to stay at home to take care of their kids, but anything is better than going out to risk catching the disease. Children can spread the disease, and also DIE from it. I am sure no parent wants their child to be the first child to die. The UK still opens schools for kids that can't stay at home, but this reduces the chances of getting it so much.

Since the earliest mention towards a direction of honouring Singaporeans who have contributed much to Singapore's development over the decades as a sovereign nation in 2015 by PM LHL, the conception of the Founders' Memorial has been a focus for national identity - a tangible feature of our forefathers, our citizens and international partners.

With a highlight on the current and past pandemics in Singapore, I am seeking a discussion to consider celebrating the inclusion of a memorial for the people who had placed themselves in the frontlines of the pandemic.

In 2007, SARS took its toll on 238 patients and claimed 33 lives. The impact of this pandemic not just created an environment of economic uncertainty but at the same time provided the government and medical institutions the exact scenario to identify gaps and hone our preparedness for future pandemic situations.

Fast forward to the current COVID-19 situation, the government and medical institutions seem well-prepared in their planning to contain the pandemic here in Singapore. Beyond managing the medical aspect of the containment and ensuring that patients receive the best care, there has been a whole slew of financial assistance and manpower bills that would help to alleviate (somewhat) the economic uncertainty that comes with this global pandemic.

Stories of those on the frontlines, be it medical, delivery and other essential manpower, there has been a highlight of their situation in the midst of this heady whirlwind of a pandemic. I feel at ease with the governmental support that employers, employees, self-employed and even unemployed would be receiving during this challenging time.

However, I would like to seek your attention on the gratitude that we should be offering to the people on the frontlines - the medical, logistics and other essential services personnel (even the NSFs and volunteers!) that are doing their utmost to keep our society intact and safe.

If we were to celebrate and honour the labour and foresight of our forefathers and pioneers, should we not celebrate and honour those who have placed themselves on the line to keep us safe? It would no longer be a celebration of just the Singaporean but the inclusion of our international friends who are here to keep Singapore intact and safe through this COVID-19 pandemic.

Singapore has always relied on the labour, knowledge and even economic support from our international friends. It is high time we look into honouring their contributions in saving lives here in Singapore.

Thus I would like to propose an additional memorial feature to the current planning of the Founders' Memorial park in Bay East Garden that would highlight the sacrifices of our medical, logistics and other essential services personnel through the SARS, the current COVID-19 and future (touch wood) pandemics.

Of course, this is just a call for action or even to plant a seed into expanding Singaporean society's awareness and celebration of such ""essential services"" in the past, now and for the future.

What do you folks think? I would love to hear from you all (please be gentle though) in this discussion or even in PMs.",,"Consideration for a ""Memorial for Essential Services"" (COVID19)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fxsf2i/consideration_for_a_memorial_for_essential/

My mom told me she went to the supermarket a few days ago and told an old uncle out of worry for his health to wear a mask but the uncle said he wasn’t afraid to die and that masks are for people who are kiasi. 

gentle reminder that staying home isnt just for your own sake. It’s for the people you love as well. Stay home for their sake. If you catch the virus ye you may say u arent afraid but what if you cause the people you love to come down with the virus also? Especially the older people you have at home like your parents. No big deal if you catch it but if you pass it to someone vulnerable you put them at risk of dying from the virus and if shit really happens i hope you r ready for that. Or worse if you getting the virus indirectly led to someone else’s death because you went out. (True story from the imported case who went to hero’s and indirectly caused one of the deaths at the crickets club. It could seriously have been prevented)

Also i just wna say that for many people their homes isn’t their safe space so maybe that’s why they have to hang out at the parks. So for those who have their homes as their safe spaces, please stay at home as much as possible when you can and leave the parks for those who really need it. I know you want to get out for fresh air coz cooping at home can be suffocating but in trying times like these try to be considerate and just really go out if you really must. 

Like what pm said, every one of us is literally at the frontline now. We must play our part to contain this. Do it for the people you love if you cant do it for yourself. Go out only if you must. If not just stay at home and tahan it. The faster we do it right, the faster our normal lives can resume. Lets all do our part because it’s really not about us anymore. It’s about everyone as a whole. 

Also shoutout to everyone in the essential sectors still going about outside so non essential people like us can have the comfort of hiding at home while waiting for the virus to pass. Thank you so much.

g86s4i,1587869629,g86s4i,3,,"Saw quite a few posts on the singing thingy last night. Was inspired to share some of my rambling thoughts on what it means to do the right thing.

.

I think it would be interesting to ask ourselves what our so-called criteria of right and wrong are. 

Some people probably try to justify right and wrong from the perspective of the law. Some people are probably more utilitarian and would argue for actions which supposedly bring the maximum material benefits to the maximum number of people. 

And some people would probably lean towards the moral/spiritual aspect. Like me here in this post.

Morally/spiritually speaking, intention is key, while actions are secondary. When the people were singing/clapping/screaming last night, what's the intention behind their actions? Do they really care about others? Or are they concerned only with themselves, even at the expense of others?

If the people were doing what they were doing out of goodwill, out of compassion, out of appreciation and care for others, as silly and stupid as their actions may seem, they are morally/spiritually doing the right thing.

.

Similarly, to the many posters in this forum, when you pass your judgments on the many seemingly 'stupid' things Singaporeans do during this trying period of time, do you really care for the community? Or are you concerned only with making yourself feel good by condemning others?

Not everyone is wise or can act wisely all the time. Especially so when it's really difficult to tell what is stupid and what is wise in the long run. But what we can all try to do is to check our intentions and try to be less selfish.

So maybe for this CB period of time when we are stuck at home banging our keyboards away, we can try not to be so concerned about appearing to be 'right'. 

Even if you disagree with what some other people do and say, try also to spend some time understanding why they do/say the 'shit' they do/say.

It's fine to criticize seriously and sincerely, but try not to mock or condemn them just to appear clever, as tempting as it may be.

FB's supposed change in policy is little impact on its hiring. My students are still getting hired by FB. What will impact job prospects are actually the bottomlines for these companies. Unlike FB, Google has announced a hiring freeze last I heard. But it's ok, ByteDance has ramped up its hiring to pick up the slack.

All in all, the pent up demand for software in Singapore is so high that it is enough to sustain all the CS majors through the upcoming COVID Depression and perhaps a bit further beyond, so not to worry. Your peers in other majors will be in a lot of trouble. Don't be too smug and don't gloat hor. You're going to be seeing serious hardship all around you. Don't complain about your pay or compare pay. Sure kenna blanket. Don't be low EQ. 

Software work is completely amenable to remote working, so we are the least affected of all professions. There are a number of extreme introverts in our rank to whom this is a complete godsend. The bigger impact will be on the rest of the economy. 

What is true is that WFH makes the good workers even more efficient because it allows them to avoid commuting costs. WFH makes the slackers even more slack and they will slack. There are actually not an insignificant number of slackers and incompetent people in the economy. These people will rapidly lose their jobs. Furthermore, the employers will realize that WFH actually works and they can save on rental, so these jobs are likely to end up outflowing overseas. Government cannot stop this. 

Back to CS, if you actually learn the skills, you will never be out of a job. Software will continue to take over more and more parts of our lives. In fact, remote working will now similarly provide our top engineers access to the highest paying SWE jobs in the US while staying safe in Singapore without worrying about public safety in Trumpland. If you don't master the skills you are expected to master, then you won't be able to compete with the cheap workers from overseas, then maybe you can figure how how Grabfood works. A lot of jobs there still.  

I have said this many times and I will say it again. CS will evolve to become exactly like law. The top CS grads will make obscene amounts of money. The competent ones will make a decent living. Those at the bottom will need to switch out and do something else. Maybe learn from the lawyers and open cafes? Kidding. CS like law, is a profession of skill and a generally useful degree. Even if you don't end up practicing, it's still good training of the mind for you to do something else. Not every law graduate will like litigation or vetting legal documents.Similarly, not every CS grad will like writing software. Then go find something else to do lah. Seriously ok.

One more piece of good news for CS majors is that the labour market for CS is *much* *much* bigger than law. And CS majors can easily access overseas jobs. There is no jurisdiction boundaries. Law is bound by jurisdiction. If you are a Singapore lawyer, you cannot just happily do legal work in the US for example.....

 Let me speak about them through this analogy:  
In Formula One, when a driver/team wins the Championship, everyone heaps praise on the driver, team management and the designers.   
Nobody seems to remember the mechanics who work tirelessly in the background to get everything fixed up. But without the mechanics, there'll be no car for the driver to win on Sunday. 

https://preview.redd.it/l2y9ghxllxf51.jpg?width=3957&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cf8ae97d5a1d5a761dba3cb49fe29b5f3cfbe7f

The same thing applies in the hospital. Pre-COVID, nurses weren't always celebrated, or receiving the same amount of recognition in the public. Without the nurses taking care of the patients 24/7, nobody will be recovering. No medical marvels can occur.

Today, our nurses are rightfully celebrated and have finally received the recognition they should have received long ago, long before the fight against COVID-19 began.

Regretfully, other groups have fallen into the same zone, which was once occupied by nurses. Take our delivery riders, and deliverymen. These brave men/women work tirelessly, rain or shine, on bicycles, scooters and Motorbikes, unprotected from the elements, while taking the risk of contracting COVID-19 everyday. Without them, everyone will need to go out to purchase their meals even when they are busy, and head to shops just to pick up their own items, resulting in large crowds everywhere.

Lastly, and certainly not least, I should also mention the Civil Service. One such group falling under this banner are the teachers. Teachers who took extra care and time to do recorded/live lessons during the Circuit Breaker period, alongside extra coaching for students on weekends through online platforms. All this took extra time, extra effort.

The next time you see/interact a delivery rider, deliveryman, or any member of the Civil Service, thank them. Thank them in any way you can, big or small, because they deserve it.

I don’t understand why school closure is not enforced, not that I wished for it to be closed, I just really dk why. Other countries are already so terrified of it that they closed schools yet MOE has yet to waver in their decision, is it because they find it too troublesome? Idk, I have no idea how the government works.

MOE is encouraging schools to prevent mass gathering, yet is CCA activities and recess not mass gathering? Idk if this is just my school but recess is going on as per normal and there’s still about about 150 people in the canteen at the same time. I know they just released statement that CCA will be suspended temporarily but why was it not before? Isn’t these all a bit contradicting when they are making schools to stop mass gathering?

MOE has also cancelled big exams but it seems contradicting to how they don’t cancel CCA activities and recesses?

A class full of students would be 40 and sitting no more than a metre away from each other in secondary and primary schools. They would also be in close contact with plenty more people during recess and CCA. So if one student gets it, chances are everyone is pretty screwed.

Some 101 people have now tested positive for the coronavirus after a cluster outbreak at clubs in Seoul’s party district of Itaewon.

Containing this latest surge in cases is a huge challenge for South Korea’s “track, trace and test” measures which have so far proved successful.

All club-goers were required to put down their names and contact numbers at the door. It was one of the guidelines for re-opening on 19 April - along with wearing masks and using hand sanitiser.

Please use your own pens.

After all, you don't want to cast your vote only to fall sick because a possibly asymptomatic carrier(be it COVID-19 or others) touched the pen you used.

The pandemic has kept people spending most of their time indoors lately, with adults working from home and children keeping indoors when they aren’t in school. I don’t know about everyone else here but there has been more frequent loud family scuffles within my block involving screaming children and the whipping sound of a cane. Is it a coincidence that I’ve been receiving more government ads now about checking in on my neighbours in case of any abuse taking place? (This isn’t really about ML algorithms but more on corporal punishment for children. And I’ve checked on the kid, he seems fine… I think.)

I’m just wondering: how do millennials these days see the use of corporal punishment in children’s upbringing? I’m assuming the older generations are still on the side of ‘spare the rod and spoil the child’ but with more psychological research published insisting that physical punishment have little positive effect and can even be detrimental to upbringing, how relevant should that be now?

I definitely have been disciplined by the cane more times than my sisters, being the oldest of 3. I’m not sure what to make of it, honestly, but I’ve seen how corporal punishment can easily turn to abuse. I’ve had my skin bleed, furniture broken and thrown at me, kicked to the floor and more. I think these are not rare incidents in SG and I don’t know how I would have turned out otherwise but I’ve seen the older generations aggressively defend the use of force to discipline children. And because I’m not one to follow traditions without good reasons, 

I’ve been doing some research (in case I ever become a parent) and most articles are from western institutions that condemn these practices. BUT I would also like to point out that parents in western countries like the USA and others in central america and south america do practice some form of corporal discipline as well but it’s usually within the privacy of their households.

Just want to know what’s the general consensus on physical punishment on children in SG now in 2020.

* Amongst the new cases today, 1 is asymptomatic, while 4 were symptomatic.
* 2 community cases, both are school students who were already on quarantine:

&gt;There are 2 cases in the community today who are contacts of a previously confirmed case. Cases 58045 and 58047 had earlier been identified as contacts of Case 57947. All 3 cases are family members residing in the same household. Cases 58045 and 58047 were placed on quarantine from 3 October, after Case 57947 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. They were swabbed on 3 October and both tested negative for COVID-19. They later developed symptoms during quarantine and subsequently tested positive on 13 October. Both cases are school students, and had last been at their respective schools on 2 October.

* 3 imported cases:

&gt;Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 58043) is a Singaporean who returned from the UK. Another (Case 58044) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Russia. The remaining case (Case 58046) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from India. They had all been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.

* 12 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
* In all, 57,752 have fully recovered from the infection.
* 39 confirmed cases who are still in hospital (0 in ICU)
* 70 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
* 28 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.

I've never actually posted before, hope I am doing this right.

2 days in a row without dorm cases.

The small victories are getting more common, signifies that the trend is good. It started showing up as 0 community cases, continued days with 0 community cases, 0 cases in PBDs, 0 cases in dorms, continued days with 0 cases in dorms, plus the massive 0 in both the dorms &amp; community on 13 Oct 2020. Hope to see all of these happening even more frequently.

We've come a long way because of our collective effort! Really, kudos to everyone as the healthcare workers &amp; government really can't do this alone. Unfortunately I think safe management measures are still here to stay for quite a while.

jgqtyt,1603471694,jgqtyt,4,,"This is going to be a lengthy post, and it's going to be one that expresses my personal opinion on this whole debacle, that is the mandatory implementation of TraceTogether starting from December onwards. While I do commend the Government for its implementation of SafeEntry (registering yourself when entering public venues and all) throughout Singapore, I cannot help but feel unjust – knowing that the Government has warranted a radical measure even after consideration with the low number of community and local COVID cases within Singapore.

**1. TraceTogether, and what does it collect?**

&gt;*""Contact-tracing device will not track location; people can use TraceTogether if they prefer.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, written by Straits Times

On 20th October 2020, Singapore has announced that starting from December onwards, [TraceTogether shall be made compulsory](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/compulsory-use-tracetogether-check-venues-such-malls-schools-workplaces-december-govt) when accessing public venues in a bid to further reopen the economy to ensure proper facilitation of contact tracing – either by app or token. The objectives of TraceTogether has been made clear by [Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan back during the Supplementary Budget 2020 Parliamentary Inquiry on TraceTogether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGvUexD1Udk&amp;t=80s), where he states:

&gt;*""Allow me to recap for members what the TraceTogether app does ... a contact tracing app which uses the phone Bluetooth function to detect other phones' nearby ... (to keep) a record of other TraceTogether users whom you happen to be in* ***close contact*** *... (and that) in the unlikely event you turn out to be positive or diagnosed with COVID-19 ... The contact tracing teams in MOH uses this to quickly identify, isolate patients, quarantine people who may be at risk...""*

Wherein during the Parliamentary Inquiry, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan has explained the rationale of making TraceTogether voluntary:

&gt;*""Today, TraceTogether has been downloaded on a voluntary basis by 1.5M users ... (and that it) is encouraging. Unfortunately, (TraceTogether) does not appear to work as well on iOS or Apple devices. as the iOS operating system actually suspends Bluetooth scanning when the app is running in the background ... (and that) because* ***TraceTogether does not work equally across all smartphones, we have decided therefore at this point in time, not to mandate the compulsory use of TraceTogether.****""*

[Dr Vivian Balakrishnan during the Parliamentary Inquiry](https://preview.redd.it/ns2da0fyivu51.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=971f608816516c725ce559e32846a93ecf382daa)

In support of Dr. Balakrishnan statements, [an independent redditor has went about extracting the TraceTogether information from his phone, and showed us the full catalog of what TraceTogether is effectively collecting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ftpc3r/oc_i_extracted_my_own_tracetogether_data_from_my/) As promised, it does not encompass anything sophisticated like GPS other than the time, contact session and other small variable factors (signal strength, phone models).

Moving on to the present day, the drastic – but unsurprising – shift towards a mandated use of TraceTogether has been presented with the necessity to maintain the standards of contact tracing in the recovery stages of our economy. The rationale of such a change, initially being that **TraceTogether does not work on all mobile platforms**, has been transformed to that of the necessity of increasing adoption, by using its data to classify close contacts in a quick and appropriate response; in which I must point that from then on, both of these rationales are not synonymous to one another.

**2. Implications and shortcomings towards TraceTogether**

Given that now we have known what was the purpose of making TraceTogether voluntary, the drastic action from one of opt-in to compulsory, and that what TraceTogether effectively collects, I can finally share my thoughts on what this whole grandeur scheme is trying to present itself as.

First of all, the efficacy on the principle of TraceTogether. No doubt, TraceTogether is a noble and just cause to ensure that contact tracing remains prevalent as the economy reopens – with more individuals interacting with one another in a recovering economy, there lies the need to improve how we contact trace altogether, alongside with SafeEntry. However, [CDC has repeatedly stated that any interactions with a case such as walking by the person or briefly being in the same room does not put you at a high risk of COVID-19](http://www.bccdc.ca/resource-gallery/Documents/Guidelines%20and%20Forms/Guidelines%20and%20Manuals/Epid/CD%20Manual/Chapter%201%20-%20CDC/2019-nCoV-Interim_Guidelines.pdf) (which by the way, [Singapore has also expressed similar statements as well](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/risk-of-being-infected-with-covid-19-while-exercising-outdoors-12649902)). This is also not to mention that [COVID-19 may also spread by indirect contact transmission (aka surface/fomite contamination)](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions), which may make contact tracing even harder without the point of origin, although there are present measures to counter this (disinfectants). Given that TraceTogether is an ""extension"" of SafeEntry in that any nearby passerby can be easily identified and so, therein lies the question on **what exactly TraceTogether is trying to achieve in its rationale and objective in terms of its efficacy?** 

Getting faster adoption? SafeEntry already does that with a universal mobile webpage or even better, the pink NRIC.

Improve contact tracing? Sure, but how feasible is it given the studies presented tonight, along with its efficacy?

Faster response? Sure, seems rational, but with SafeEntry being appropriate for the job and the element of human behaviour (and its ability of inertia), how certain are we to say that TraceTogether will be efficient in delivering its efficacy? Why make a voluntary choice mandatory if faster response is what you want?

[An independent redditor has showed what TraceTogether has been collecting](https://preview.redd.it/l43vk8c0jvu51.png?width=1373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5330d034021b497b3ac66aa3938c3d0d9062065)

Secondly, data collection. I'm not going to bore you with the details of privacy invasion (which has been overstated here), but I would like to raise a new question on this particular topic – [most notably by the same independent redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ftpc3r/oc_i_extracted_my_own_tracetogether_data_from_my/). Recall again that TraceTogether also collects other small variable factors such as phone models and signal strength. **Is there any exact rationale towards collecting such irrelevant information such as the phone models of what your ""pings"" are using – and why is this in conflict with the former rationale: that it is supposed to collect a record of other TraceTogether users whom you happen to be in close contact?** Furthermore, the retrieval of a more concerning variable, *the signal strength*, may point to a **more critical fundamental flaw towards the entire TraceTogether app**. Say that TraceTogether is meant to isolate ""close contacts"" of the infected as stipulated previously, then how is TraceTogether supposed to classify what constitutes a ""close contact""? Does prolonged time but weak signal strength bring enough justification of a close contact, or how about an extremely strong signal strength in a relatively short amount of time? How about friends visiting, relatives, and whatsoever that may accidentally be include into this list of ""fake close contacts""?

The point I'm trying to bring here is that if these Bluetooth devices (phone and token alike) give varying signal strength to one another, **then there is no certainty that definitively proves one is a close contact or not; making such data not only unnecessary** (phone models) **but also dangerously unreliable.** The idea that you might be considered a ""close contact"" or not, simply due to the fact that your token / phone is able to pick up the signal or not, might be the start to a prelude of ""possible incidents"" to come – and nobody will even question it under the guise of being a ""safety measure"". Also, for your information, I have not even brought up the possibility of ""hijacking the token"", as [history serves us to remember](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/personal-info-of-15m-singhealth-patients-including-pm-lee-stolen-in-singapores-most), so I will leave it up to your own imagination to think what will exactly happen if ""that"" happens.

&gt;*""If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Andrew Lewis

Lastly, the cost of maintenance of these tokens itself. These tokens are not meant to stand the test of time; and [another independent redditor has given up the numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jfrqne/tracetogether_hardware_is_a_failure/) to showcase the expenditure of this entire project: S$60M++ semiannually. Now, I am sure all of us here are [all too keenly aware on how sturdy these little ""AirPods"" are](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j5iqny/my_tracetogether_token_had_split_open_when_it_hit/), but as I will mention it again: is the efficacy of such a measure justified given that they are breakable + not waterproof and that people may accidentally (or intentionally) forget these tokens, or is this as they claim it to be: a creative way to hype up the numbers to prove ownership of such tokens among Singaporeans?

**3. SGSecure: its inspirations and comparison with TraceTogether**

I think discussing TraceTogether may have reminded me on another policy that the Government has done so previously: SGSecure. Back in 2016, [SGSecure has been implemented by the Government to utilize the high penetration of mobile phones here to combat terrorism activities through their policy: Run, Hide, Tell](https://www.sgsecure.gov.sg/) – which honestly speaking, I feel that it bears too much resemblance to the [US Active Shooter Policy when you see a school shooter: Run, Hide, Fight](https://www.ready.gov/active-shooter) (and therein lies the question why SG doesn't want us to defend ourselves, but rather to spam their hotlines...). Now, it is a given that both policies (US Active Shooter Policy, SGSecure) were taken to combat domestic and foreign terrorist attacks, but **are the circumstances presented in the US applicable to us Singaporeans?** I raise this question to you all: in the event of a catastrophic incident within Singapore where help requires time to arrive, would it be considered sound policy to ""tell"" and spam our national hotlines to overwhelm the capacity of our own frontline officers, even when alternatives are readily available to do the same capacity as that of SGSecure? (calling 999, 995)

[A noteworthy SGSecure review](https://preview.redd.it/44pfm03wivu51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4093575a90c0b86a8196436b45221afe4219362)

While I do acknowledge the differences between TraceTogether and SGSecure, and that yes – I should not be making **that** comparison when both of them serves different purposes, I want to raise the similarities between them: and that is what TraceTogether and SGSecure have in common is that it **requires high user participation in the program, utilizing Singapore's high penetration on smartphones to ensure a fast and steady response by our Home Team.** However, despite the noble intentions by the Government on the initiation of these programs, many Singaporeans remain uncertain on participating on such a program, [so much so that even the SGSecure App comes pre-installed into your Samsung smartphone if you have ordered it from Singapore back then](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mobile-app-serve-eyes-and-ears-during-emergencies). Now then, is this simply just a lack of trust on our own Government, or is this something larger than ourselves as a society?

**4. Efficacy of policies, and a possible start to a ""dangerous"" precedent?**

&gt;*""They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Benjamin Franklin

Now, I am not going to end this on a high note that ""privacy is the most important to us all"" (look at the US for the consequences), but rather that we can conclude that **our policies have started to shift fundamentally from its main objectives**, and that there is the really true possibility that for once: there is a presence of **a misallocation of resource by the Government in dealing with national crisis** (terrorism, pandemic). While this trend is hard to say and that that time can only tell, it is still a fundamental principle to have a well-informed and cynical civilian populace in our address against this crisis. Moreover, should our apathetic approach continue to dominate the rest of the country, it may be taken as approval of its policies, and may be the start of a prelude on something more sinister.

TLDR; TraceTogether is not the foolproof measure, possible leaks and limitations exposed, and that its efficacy may be something of a serious matter despite it being another tool in effectively dealing with COVID.

fixusk,1584258282,fixusk,5,,"I understand that this may not be the perfect place to ask this, but I was planning to travel to Australia to visit family, and had a flight later this week.  The situation with COVID has led the Australian Government to impose a 14 day quarantine on arrival, which is fine given that I'm visiting to spend time with family.  

What I hope to learn more about, is how this may affect flights back.  I have a flight back to Singapore for mid April, and need to be back in Singapore to start my new year at university in June.  My primary concern is that while I can get to Australia, there is a risk that Airlines may close flights between Australia and Singapore, perhaps due to loss of revenue, leaving me stranded.  

I am of the understanding that if the government is to close borders or flights, there would be a window of time for me to scramble onto a flight back before a flight-ban comes into effect, as seen in the American-Europe situation.  However, if a cancellation of flights is to come from the carriers themselves, ie. SIA, there may be no such window.

Therefore, my question is if anyone has any information regarding the ability of carriers to cancel flights between certain locations.  Frankly, any information or insight regarding flying in these times would be very much appreciated, whether relevant to my problem or not.

its too late now. but it seems like my sompo traveljoy purchased on feb 16 for bali apr26 doesn't cover travel cancellation (unless perhaps if indonesia closes down bali).  


right now singapore's quarantine on return policies for asean countries has basically put off any reason to travel. its an outright ban yet the way its worded that probably doesn't allow travel insurance claims. (ie: you can travel if you want, just that you will get locked up at home for 14 days on your return)  


 I was reading a few policies. eg: 

MSIG:

We will pay for the unused travel fare, accommodation charges and deposits the insured person has paid or payments which the insured person legally has to pay and which cannot be recovered from any other source, if the journey is unexpectedly and unavoidably cancelled due to any of the following reasons which take place within 30 days before the start of the journey but after the date of arranging this insurance and the journey.

7. Epidemic or pandemic at the planned overseas destination as declared by the World Health Organisation.

  
so if i did buy msig, i would be covered for the trip cancellation.  


so any frequent savvy flyers, please recommend insurance companies that do what is reasonably sensible.

flq0bg,1584684704,flq0bg,5,,"Hello  all,

My sister travelled to Bulgaria on 9th March and was due to come back on the 23rd. Her flight was cancelled, and instead of booking the next earliest flight back, she decided she wants to extend her stay to around the 30th instead (yes, I am aware that the flight may not even go on on that date, and believe me, I have tried talking her into coming back early until my face turned blue).

Based on the current situation in Bulgaria, I'm not sure how widespread the coronavirus actually is over there, but I know the numbers are climbing quite steadily. A person at the town she's currently at has passed away due to the virus.

As ya'll know, she will be required to serve a stay home notice upon coming back (based on current updates). 

However, there's a bit of a problem - she lives with my mom, who is nearly 70 and has pre-existing conditions (e.g high blood pressure). She is also sharing a room with another sister of mine. I don't really want to take the risk of letting her stay together at home with my mom during the SHN, and would very much rather she serves her SHN at another location when she is back. I've called MOH today and they have confirmed that it is fine to serve the SHN at another location, as long as they know where you will be, and that best kind of place would be a room with a toilet and amenities that will allow them to live in there by themselves.

So, I have a couple of questions:-

1. Do any of you know of anyone who served their SHN at another location? If so, what kind of places did they stay at, and how did they manage their day-to-day living (e.g. food, or smoking if you're a smoker)? Basically, what was the experience like, and what are some things to consider regarding serving SHN at another location other than the place of residence?

2. Do you guys have any recommendations of places to stay? I'll admit I haven't had the chance to look into places yet, but I will tonight. I'm hoping some suggestions can be thrown at me so I can look into the feasibility of it.

I'm just hoping I can get some feedback and advice that I can work around with. Sorry if the questions sound stupid but I'm honestly quite panicky about her being there.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been suffering for borderline anxiety, and a som kinda of high functioning depression over the years. I had a consult with  atherapist  last month Nobember, and in light if the virus it has been hard for me finsncially/timing for me to keep it up. I've been to about 2 session, which didnt go indepth with my personal childhood trauma/problems, mainly because I was still extremely anxious about everything that was going on and did not open up properly. And honestly 2 sessions didnt't really so much if you're closed off like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I was thinking. How does client-GP confidentiality work? And if so, what are the steps they will take to ensure your well-being, especially about not confiding in emergency services/police. Especially if i were to be absolutely honest with the pills I've been taking?

&amp;#x200B;

Why I'm asking this is that.. well. There has been a few instances where I manage to get 5mg of tramezepam, which has helped with my anxiety during the day' and helped me sleep. Yes I know.. to not get a prescription is asking for trouble.

I just don't want to escalate this to my emplayment which may deem me as a liability to my team.

Don't really know what else to explain. Any kind of knowlesge anyome has on this (patients, doctors, psychs and therapists) i would really greatly appreciate.

Based on the official definition provided by gov.sg, DORSCON Red would imply that:

- There’s a severe disease spreading widely
- There’re major disruptions to everyday life (ie school and workplace closures and many deaths)

With that, it seems like the only point left that is against going to DORSCON Rex would be a high amount of deaths (at 7, accurate as of 10/04/20).

Objectively and based off the Government’s description of DORSCON Red, it would seem that it would be an inevitability in the near future for the readiness levels to further increase.

However, I personally feel that going to DORSCON Red would not improve the response (as the Government can already implement stringent measures, albeit under weird names), and would just create panic and further fear mongering amongst the Singaporean public, which might induce a new wave of panic-induced actions (ie panic buying).

I have been lurking around to see if anyone has posted this question in the past. apparently not, so I'm posting; a little background of myself, late 20s and working in the science industry for more than 5 years, (histotechnician before, orthopaedic product specialist currently). went poly and have a B.S in medical bioscience in a private uni (UK). As per subject, I would like to do a career switch to psychology/counselling. my idea is to help/counsel traumatic client (ie. maybe teenagers/kids) or any mental disorder. 

I understand that I need to get a master degree in clinical psychology in order to practice. and I know how competitive the program offered in NUS and JCU are. I do not want to put my hopes here bc my chance of getting it rather small with regarding to zero experience in this field. not shutting down this idea tho. Also, I saw SUSS offering master in counselling and I'm waiting for their application to be open. but let's say I didn't get in. I would like to see what others options do I have on the table. I saw that College of Allied Educators is offering courses but, I'm slightly sceptical with the qualification as to be a counsellor. 

I'm not sure what other ways to go about doing this, and I sincerely hope anyone could have input in this or any kind soul actually had a career switch psychology/counselling at my age. 

P.S I dont want to spend another 4 years studying a B.S/B.A in psychology bc I still need a master degree after that. I want to work around with what I already got.

iiq8nj,1598696952,iiq8nj,5,,"For a little background, I'm 16M, I've been in Singapore for the past few years, and of course I was here when the pandemic started. After not seeing my friends for around 4 months, my family decided to go to America for a summer trip so we could make the most out of the year, but around halfway through the trip, we ended up catching Covid-19. We didn't think much of it, being largely asymptomatic, so after testing positive for the antibodies for around a month, we decided to head back to Singapore, where our life was. Of course, a 14 day quarantine is no big price to pay for returning to our normal lives again. 

The problem came 12 days into the quarantine, when we did the swab test. A day after we did the testing, even though my entire family did fine, my sister results came back with a weak positive, and she was immediately brought to a hospital for further testing. Me and my family were then immediately placed into another 14 day quarantine, and we were put in another hotel (hilton garden inn). 

Now, in normal circumstances, I would be completely fine with this. I am certainly aware of how seriously Singapore takes this pandemic, and I acknowledge and respect it to the highest degree. The reason I'm having a hard time getting a grip is the fact that as soon as my sister got to the hospital, she tested negative twice, where she was able to leave the hospital and roam freely again.....while we have another 12 days to go, quarantining because of someone who tested negative.

Overall global statistics death rate is 2 to 3% but most are elderly and sick with complications already. The true death rate may be much lower due to the fact a lot who are infected did not report due to no or mild symptoms.

                  The Multi-Ministry Taskforce regularly reviews our border measures to manage the risk of importation and onward local transmission from travellers. Given the surveillance regime that we have put in place for travellers serving Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at their own residence, we will also adopt a risk-based approach and allow more travellers to serve their 14-day SHN at a suitable place of residence. From 1 January 2021, all incoming travellers will also be required to pay for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, and will be responsible for their inpatient medical bills if they have onset of symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days of their entry to Singapore.

More Travellers Allowed to Serve 14-Day SHN at Suitable Place of Residence

2.               Currently, except for countries that we have unilaterally opened up to, travellers from selected low risk countries/ regions serve a 7-day SHN at their place of residence or suitable accommodation of their choice, and all other travellers serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.

3.               Since 11 August 2020, all travellers serving SHN outside of dedicated SHN facilities are required to don an electronic monitoring device throughout their SHN. This complements agencies’ checks to ensure compliance with the SHN. With the enhanced surveillance regime in place, we will also adopt a risk-based approach and allow more travellers from Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Norway, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey[1] to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:

         a.     Travelled to no other country than above-mentioned countries, in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and

         b.     Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.

4.               Travellers from the abovementioned countries may apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities from 2 November 2020, for arrivals on or after 4 November 2020. For Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs), the application must be made prior to arrival via the Safe Travel Office website. Travellers who are not SCs or PRs may apply to opt out as part of the entry approval process. All travellers must present the approval to opt out upon arrival in Singapore. As the list of countries will be updated from time to time depending on the public health risk assessment, all travellers must be prepared to be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including stay in dedicated SHN facilities and payment, where applicable.

5.               All travellers who opt to stay at their place of residence for SHN must remain in their declared place of residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN or make false declarations. Such persons will also be required to utilise specially designated transport services from the checkpoint to their place of residence and to their respective testing facilities, and bear the costs[2] for these transport arrangements.

All Travellers to Bear Costs of Stay at Dedicated SHN Facilities and COVID-19 Treatment

6.               The Government has thus far borne the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities and medical bills for COVID-19 treatment for SCs and PRs who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020. The Government has also borne the costs of COVID-19 medical bills for new SCs/ PRs/ Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs), and existing LTPHs who departed Singapore before 27 March 2020. All other incoming travellers have had to pay for these costs as part of their private expenses, subject to the applicable healthcare arrangements for their bills[3].

7.               Stay in self-isolation facilities is now a widely-accepted requirement of international travel in a COVID-19 world. The vast majority of SCs and PRs who last left Singapore within the past year have returned. Hence with effect from 1 January 2021, we will no longer waive the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities for SCs and PRs who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020.

 8.               Similarly, with effect from 1 January 2021, all returning SC/ PR/ LTPH travellers who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020, as well as new SCs/ PRs/ LTPHs will also be responsible for their inpatient medical bills, should they develop onset of symptoms within 14 days of their arrival in Singapore, but they will be able to tap on regular healthcare financial arrangements for their inpatient medical bills – SCs and PRs may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life / Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills, while LTPHs may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance.

Regular Review of Border Measures

9.               Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the global situation changes. We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment. If the situation in a country/region deteriorates, more stringent measures will be put in place to limit the risk of importation and prevent community transmission from imported cases.

This must be known and made aware.

2019-nCoV    does not just invade your system and target lungs, leading to    Pneumonia.  It can also infiltrate into the muscle cells of the heart    and cause Myocarditis / Heart Conditions.  What I will do is cover over   Myocarditis.  Then I  will lay out the pieces of information that line   up to what is  happening to some of the people observed collapsing.

[Myocarditis](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/myocarditis) is [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) of the [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart/picture-of-the-heart) muscle (myocardium). Exactly how many people are affected is hard to know because it often has no symptoms.

Many people who get myocarditis are otherwise healthy. Many  things can lead to it.

VIRAL INFECTION is the most common cause of Myocarditis.- [https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/myocarditis#1](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/myocarditis#1)\- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis)

Symptoms can include

Shortness of breath

Chest pain

Decreased ability to exercise

Irregular heartbeat

Complications may include [heart failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure) due to [dilated cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy) or [cardiac arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest).

Myocarditis    is a rare complication of many viral syndromes. Most commonly   described  viral etiologies are adenovirus, coxsackievirus, CMV,  HIV,   and  parvovirus B-19. We present a rare case of coronavirus related   fulminant  myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: Nine month old male presented   with two  day history of  cough, rhinorrhea, and fever. Initial vitals   were  significant for  respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute and a   heart  rate of 180 beats  per minute...   It is possible further cases   of  coronavirus associated myocarditis will  be diagnosed with  increased   availability of more comprehensive PCR  testing for common  viral   pathogens.

Cardiovascular complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)

Severe    acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a virulent viral infection  that    affects a number of organs and systems. This study examined if SARS    may  result in cardiovascular complications.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596695/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596695/)

In    patients with SARS, cardiovascular complications including    hypotension  and tachycardia were common but usually self limiting.    Bradycardia and  cardiomegaly were less common, while cardiac arrhythmia    was rare.  However, only tachycardia persisted even when   corticosteroid  therapy  was withdrawn.

The   novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified as a cause of pneumonia; however, it has not been   reported  as a cause of acute myocarditis. A 60-year-old man presented with pneumonia and congestive heart failure. On the first day of   admission,  he was found to have an elevated troponin-I level and severe   global  left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography.

.

Here are some quotes from the article:

&gt;Referring to Wang as a “young man” in a Friday, Feb. 21 Facebook post, where she shared an article from Nikkei Asian Review, Ho said it is “counterproductive” for the Chinese foreign minister to urge other countries to lift the travel ban.

&gt;This is because China is still imposing restrictions on its countrymen within its own borders, the 66-year-old wrote.

&gt;She further said: “There is a time and place, and this is not the time and place.” (*referring to the meeting on 20 Feb where ASEAN and China foreign ministers met to discuss on working together to deal with the virus outbreak*)

.

More quotes from the article:

&gt;Wang had also voiced his concerns about Singapore’s “restrictive measures” to Singapore’s foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Wednesday evening, Feb, 19, saying he hoped “normal exchanges” between Singapore and China can resume as soon as possible now that “the epidemic has eased and the situation is under control”.

.

Outwardly in public, China often appears polite to Singapore, but we don't know what their government really thinks about us.

But we do know that China is big and powerful, and is starting to push its weight around the region in recent years. And there were times when we can even feel them pressuring us directly.

We know China is going through really tough times now. It's a very terrible situation over there right now. We also know their economy is significantly affected. But please, *don't push your weight around*, and make demands on us to solve certain specific problem of yours, especially when they are inappropriate. Because we also have our own set of problems.

.

Just read this forum's top post a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f79g8a/rant_from_a_simple_ntuc_part_timer/

Similarly, this message goes to customers who go around stores trying to find and buy much wanted items during this period of time.

*Don't push your weight around.*

Everyone is stressed. Don't pile on the stress. Even if you are worried and scared and angry and frustrated, do remind yourself that the person in front of you may be feeling so too.

Don't regard the other person like shit.

.

I'm not sure how long this virus situation will last. But it's going to be a testy period for all of us. People are scared and angry. Lots of tension in the air. And in our frustration, it's easy to lash out and start pushing *all* blame on others.

People pushing all blame on the government. Government pushing blame on the people. One group angry at another group. Another group angry with this group. This group angry with that group.

I'm not such this is how we can get through a crisis.

.

Let's remind each other, we don't just have internal problems. We are facing external issues too.

Just like how we don't want countries of power to push their weight around on us, whatever power we have (however limited it is), let's not abuse it for our own selfish benefit/ego/pride at the expense of others.

The situation gets worse during recess since some people don't sit at their own designated seating arrangements, sit close to other people, and are standing close to each other while queuing up. 

Even students are not completely safe from the virus. There was a boy from RI who tested positive for the virus. Recently in France, a healthy 16 year old girl  without any passed away from the virus which started off as a mild cough last week. Even people as young as them can get the virus. 

With all the e-learning, closure of all entertainment venues in Singapore and gatherings outside of school limited to 10 people, students can't just go out and hang out with friends.

Mushroom farmer William Leong, 56, who had flown in from Thailand on March 21, said he was told by an officer that his SHN would start the next day.

“I asked him what I should do today and he said I was free to do whatever I wanted until it kicked in the next day,” said Mr Leong who “happily” made plans to head out for dinner.

But he said his wife was sceptical about this. He later called the Ministry of Manpower hotline to double check the information.

“That’s when I realised it was wrong. Thankfully, I didn’t go out and eat bak kut teh,” he said.

Message from our NCID colleagues are asking for male clothes donation for decanted dorm patients.   
&gt;  
&gt;Our dorm patients are increasing and although NCID provide them  hospital baju, once they are decanted to Expo or chalet they have no  other clothes other than the piece they were wearing upon admission. Due  to the quarrantine, no one can collect their clothes and pass to them.  Hence it would be very helpful if you can donate \*male clothes of any  size\* so that they could at least have one extra piece for washing and  changing. T shirts / Shorts / Pants. Please PM Ben 81865196 if you are  keen to donate, looking for clothes in good condition. Ideally new  clothing but not wanted or used but in good condition. This is because,  there’s no time to filter through the clothing.

I'm starting this thread for all to share:

• your recent experience with grab services
• frontline issue with grab
• issue with grab that you had faced this past few weeks during the covid situation or circuit breaker period too

I hope this can bring awareness so we can know what's happening and maybe try to see what can we do to help or get help if there's any issue. 

Psa: I myself wasn't that affect but my relative was, he was a grab driver.. He tried to apply to do different job on the grab platform such as grabfood or delivery service they have. 

However, there was no news at all from the company.. so basically they literally just dump hailing drivers empty handed??  My uncle struggled to find a replacement job asap, like he has family of 7 to feed.

gp2p21,1590229830,gp2p21,6,,"I write simply on the following premise:
1. Worldwide trend of Covid has not reached its peak yet. Some countries do not have the capacity to implement measures for various reasons and the information received about them are unreliable.  
2. The likelihood of a 'second wave' that could impact Singapore as measures are loosened, especially with regards to peoples' movement in and out of the country.  
3. The Singapore government is supporting the expenses of the foreign dorm workers that are currently not in any reasonable working capacity.  

Based on the above, it is my opinion that:  
1. There is a reliance on foreign dorm workers to build the infrastructure necessary for the effective handling of possible 'second wave'.  
2. If the foreign dorm workers are put to work and not handled properly, the risk of transmission amongst themselves increases and could lead to a domestic 'second wave', resulting in greater societal impact of other sectors.  
3. Spending on foreign dorm workers is not sustainable long term if the workers are not put to work for good use.   

Recommendation:  
While I understand that there is a public demand to punish dormitory operators for their profit-maximising policies that led to the worsening of the current situation, this is something that would have to be postponed until the situation is controlled.  
The time-critical thing to do is:  
1. Separate the workers in batches, such that the healthy ones can be returned to work, in order to build the facilities and infrastructure required to handle 'second wave'.  
Each batch of workers, as much as possible, has to be isolated and have limited contact with non-essential staff.  
2. Singapore government has to take control of the building of such facilities, especially the dormitories that will house the workers, to ensure they fulfill health criteria.  
3. Singapore government has to let the public know that the foreign workers are essential at this time, and that now is not the time to enact punitive measures on private dormitory operators. Such measures will occur at a future date when the situation has stabilised.

True story k no astroturfing. 

I live in a hdb (I am poor). Yesterday, someone knocked on my door at night. I thought must be salesman. Recently a lot of salesman and property agents. 

It was a lady in a red shirt. She greeted me and introduced herself as someone from psp. She asked if I would be voting in the election. I immediately thought ok not bad she did not assume I’m a maid. Probably because I unfortunately was standing there shirtless in my panties. Duck that normally scares away the sales people. But I did not want to scare these people away with my panties. 

Anyway I went and put on some presentable clothing, my hatsune miku T-shirt (never wash for a week alr).  The lady patiently waited for me to get dressed. I decided probably no time for a shower. She asked me if I have heard of psp. With all my willpower I resisted the urge to shout I have been a loyal fan all my life starting from the very first sony PlayStation! Of course I have heard of psp. In fact my classmates in primary sch were all sega Saturn supporters tuck them. Only when I invited them to my house to play twisted metal and bushido blade then they realised ps is obviously better. But yeah I replied the psp lady of course, it’s dr tan Cheng bocks party. In fact I grew up in west coast grc under him and he personally handed me many scholarships and bursaries (i have humble background). She asked if I knew any candidates in the grc. I diligently recited the names of the four candidates which I knew by heart because I am an active and responsible r/Singapore subreddit user. Unfortunately I ducked up the Malay name and said abdul raman. Anyway yeah 3/4. The psp lady was pleased though,  this means I score top percentile already. We did not discuss any policy issues I suppose cos psp doesn’t actually have any policy besides vote for tcb and no blank Cheque. She asked if I would be voting psp. I said of course I would be voting! She happily left. (I never said voting what right?) 

Conclusion: not bad I was not accused of being a maid, lady seemed friendly for an unpaid volunteer. Respect people who do grassroots and take action instead of vxxxxxxxxxx  online like you xxxxxxxx on this subreddit. 


So today I met a pap volunteer. This time I was out buying lunch. So not in panties. Still wearing the exact same hatsune miku shirt (wfh means don’t need do laundry, can’t rem the last time I did laundry). I must say the all white and lightning look really a bit daunting sia. Compared to friendly psp. All our lives we have been told to obey and comply the white so subconsciously my buibui belly also shrank a bit seeing these elites. 

I had a conversation with a pap man maybe around my age (mystery).  He told me he was a volunteer not one of the candidates (I asked him are you a candidate). Heh of course I knew exactly who were the four candidates. Interestingly he could recite the full plan of what the pappies were going to do to improve both the infrastructure, culture and other tangible things for this slum town area we live in. I wonder if they force the volunteers to memorize this. I asked him why did he choose to volunteer for the pap instead of playing dota daily like me. He said something about wanting to help the people. Ok I guess. I can’t even stand to help my idiot teammates in dota he can stand helping the public so noble. I asked him whether he is from civil service. He said no, he from private sector. I pressed him more, he is from a GLC. Overall, I concluded from this one anecdotal meeting that the pap volunteer seems to know more and presented more facts and plans. We parted amicably with him thinking I was gonna vote for pappy. 

Having met a sample size of one volunteer each, i conclude that I feel more confident discussing stuff with strangers when I’m wearing more than just panties. Grassroots people so selfless I am touched by the Singapore spirit.

i01xip,1596034009,i01xip,6,," You may have come across a Facebook post, about a member of public’s encounter on the train with an elderly woman who works as a cleaner. The elderly woman was quoted as saying that she was seeking additional employment to earn a living.

Our Social Service Office (SSO) colleagues have identified the elderly woman, Mdm L. She is staying in a five-room flat with her son’s family. The family has a domestic helper. Her son provides her with food and shelter but she works to supplement her other expenses. Our SSO colleagues visited her yesterday to see if she needed any help and how we can lend support.

Our records show that Mdm L is a permanent resident, and she has not applied for citizenship in the past. Prior to the COVID-19 circuit breaker, Mdm L received a monthly gross salary of about $1,300 (excluding CPF) from her employer. Due to reduced business volume, her employer had arranged for her and other full-time employees to work part-time as a way to retain staff. She is currently paid $675 for working part-time in 4-hour shifts (or about $6.50/hr). We understand from her employer that when business improves, they will review and reinstate the cleaners’ part-time employment to full-time.

To mitigate the impact of Mdm L’s wage loss during this difficult period, MSF is assessing her eligibility for the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG), which provides monthly payouts of $500 - $800.

As a non-citizen, she does not qualify for Silver Support or Workfare. However, she receives benefits like the Solidarity Payment that are also extended to PRs. In addition, we will support her in other ways. Grassroots organisations will support her with $120 food vouchers monthly for the next six months. We are also arranging for her to get some help for her medical expenses.

The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has verified that Mdm L’s elder son, a regular warrant officer, died during a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) freefall training session in South Africa, in May 2009. Full compensation was paid out to his family. MINDEF and the SAF extend their deepest condolences to the family.

Building an inclusive and a caring society is a collective effort. We appreciate the effort of members of the public in reaching out to those who seem to be in need. However, posting and sharing their circumstances on social media may lead to further distress for these vulnerable groups of people and their families. Such posts may not correctly reflect the circumstances of vulnerable groups of people, who may be elderly, or may not share all the details accurately because of the stressors they are facing.

We encourage members of the public to please link them up directly with us through our SSOs or any Family Service Centre. In the case of Mdm L, she indicated she was unaware of being photographed or that her comments and photo would be shared in public on social media.

ja9c7z,1602577557,ja9c7z,6,,"tl:dr visited StarShield 3rd time, they still impressed me with their service, attitube and professionalism. 

This post is to share about my experience with StarShield, and compared them to some of the neighbourhood repair store.

In the past, I used to bring my pc time to time with variety of issues to the downstair repair store. The issues range from power connector to motherboard malfunctioning. What they did is simply wipe everything and call it a fix (they informed me), but only to extend lifespan of max a month. Contacted them and they denied their granted repair warranty.

Perhaps, they may not be even certified to do repair, and watched ton of repair video from youtube and apply those knowledge to earn cheap bucks. OR maybe i too naive that make me an easy target to trick.

Im glad they closed down, out of business due to covid19. 

3rd time visited StarShield today, bringing my dad laptop that suffering from blue screen of death. The technician did lot of testing for almost 2 hours, concluded the fault is the motherboard. Knowing he didnt do any shit, he discounted the accessment fees (probably also becuz showing him the result of the SFC and DSIM scan I did yesterday, saved him lot of time) which i happily paid for.

The most important is throughout the process of the diagnosis (which i mentioned take almost 2 hour), he shown lot of patient, profficiency, efficiency and handling in his accessment of the laptop, took out lot of component, equipment for the testing, I felt so impressed. Although maybe im too easily to impress, and this is what a good technician should do and behave. But still, Im fascinated. 

Before I conclude this post, i want to point out that not every neighbourhood or small repair stores are bad. There are pretty professional technician who operate such store and did a fantastic job in the repair and satisfied their customer. What bad experience I share is just a few store that I visited. Here just few tips if you planning to take your laptop/pc for accessment and repair in the future.

• Readup some technical knowledge from trustable site. there are some software side of problem can be diy fixed.

• If you are young and uncertain, bring an adult/your parent to acommpany you during the visit, the technician with malicious intent may take your job srsly. Ask for their certification when in doubt of their abilitiy to perform repair

• Dont repair thing your own especially if hardware is involved (i learnt this hard way), leave it to the expert. Unless you are cerified or know what the hecl you are doing.

disclaimer: feel distressed, dk what to do. very lost bc i feel so helpless and incapable to do anything.

hello,, i really feel loved by the outpouring comments and messages i received from my prev post. tqsm, that rly gave me energy to feel alive. now i need advice to move forward. 

i had a medical appt with my psychologist today, but i feel like i jus cannot connect with him as he kept saying i was confusing him (so i had to explain to him several times). and in b/w the convo, there will be lots of awkward pauses and he will ask me ""how do u feel abt it"" or ""what do u think abt it"" when honestly ive said what i needed to say...sometimes i ponder if im the one who has a problem b/c i have ady switched psychologist once...so shd i change to another one? altho it has only been one month w my current psych, i jus felt like we were constantly at diff wavelengths. 

more imptly, he was suggesting me to move out instead (due to the family environment and the other reasons which i mentioned in my reddit post), but the thing is im not financially stable now as my parents prevly quit my retail job w/o my consent. til now, my bosses cant give me a definite answer. but i rly need the income. during this pandemic season, its not easy for me to find another job that is near my location, has flexible timings and offers average pay. due to my health condition, im unable to travel far to work for long hours. so ive been really troubled with finances. as much as im providing home tuition now (fortunately), it definitely isnt enough for me to cover my medical bills and have food in the long run (which is why i only eat 1 meal a day for now). i prevly did a one-time off fundraising, but i felt as if it was so unethical of me to take people's money for me to seek priv mental health treatment, when others prob need it way more than me. initially i received more than required, so i donated it to mental health organisations. but subsequently i got into crisis, so my medical appts became even more frequent. if i drag it, i will lack medical attention. i have switched from hospital to hospital, and now to a priv clinic. im also tired to switch again. reason why i switched from hospital to hospital was bc they said they couldnt rly help me and all would jus refer me to imh (which is rly not what i want). sometimes i rly feel like a burden b/c i rly didnt choose to be like this. i wish i can drag it. but sometimes i jus feel so overwhelmed i cant take it, and my parents wish i can just rely on my willpower and pretend im not feeling depressed/anxious - so that the medical bills wont be so huge (i still try to fund most of it alone). i have siblings too, so all the more im sure its barely enuf for them. and since they are studying, id rather they receive more than i do (due to exp edu fees as well...) and work it out alone... 

as for moving out, for sure i do not feel safe and happy staying at home, but it doesnt seem to be a viable solution for me to move out due to finances and law issues (since im still considered a minor) now. idk what to do from here. please help me. the solutions proposed are easier said than done. idk how long more i can pull through...

I don't blame anyone if they don't want to watch it. Its about 20 minutes long.

So  the too long; didn't watch version is that the company claims their  product can make a person a lot of money by trading cryptocurrency. They  have a system that allows it to go on nearly auto pilot, and some  people have turned 250 dollars into tens of thousands of dollars. This  is only possible because the pandemic as caused governments worldwide to  spend a lot of money on relief programs. That money has to go somewhere  and the system hones in on where the money is going.

Is  this too good to be true? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I didn't sign up  for the paid course. The only ""proof"" they have in saying they aren't a  scam is saying reputable press outlets such as the Straits times and  others have attested to their system, and a bunch of videos of  individual people saying ""I made a bunch of money!"" Those same people on  the video never specify what made them a lot of money, just that they  made a lot of money.

My scam alert gauge is going through the roof.

Two  things of note before I go on. 1. I live in Singapore. This is  important because the program states that only Singaporeans can enroll  in this. They gave me a very detailed reason why but I can't recall all  the details.

2. Its under a name Oliver James, of whom I could not find anything on.

A  few days later I find another YouTube Ad advertising the same things,  but under a different name. Ok, maybe a different company is offering  something very similar. Its possible. But upon clicking the link and  signing up for the free intro, I get the SAME exact video, and the SAME  exact email from Oliver James.

I  decide to proceed so that I can at least talk to a live person. No  commitment, no credit card or bank info, nothing just my phone number  and name. A few minutes later a get a call from someone and I  immediately ask about if they're a scam. They said they are not and that  if they are my bank will konw and not disperse the money. I said its  not good enough, what proof do you have? I've been scammed before, and  I'm not about to get scammed again. He just said the bank would know. I  told him my bank is American, because even though I live in Singapore, I  am an American. He then says that he can't proceed because this is for  Singaporeans only, and that is the end of the phone call.

Does  this sound like a scam? Hell yes. But could it be, hoping against hope,  that this was just a poorly done advertisement and that there is some  validity to their claims? Has anyone ever run into this?

Does YouTube vet their ads before allowing them to be run? Or is YouTube an avenue to run ads for scams?

SINGAPORE: It will be mandatory for all workers returning from mainland China to be placed on a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) as Singapore steps up measures to contain the coronavirus situation, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (Feb 6).  


Employers must notify the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before their employees return so that the Government can “stagger the return of these workers and manage the flow better”, added Mr Wong.

 

A [S$100 daily allowance](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-bans-travellers-from-hubei-12361268) will be extended to all employers whose workers are placed on Leave of Absence (LOA). The allowance was previously only given to employers whose workers are quarantined, or self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs) who are quarantined.

Mr Wong said on Thursday the foreign worker levy will also be waived during the employee’s period of absence from work. 

“The businesses are equally affected (and) projects are being delayed,” he said on the sidelines of a visit to a foreign worker’s dormitory at Tuas. “So we've heard the concerns of employers.”

 

Employers who face difficulties finding accommodation for their workers to serve out their LOA can approach MOM for help, Mr Wong added. 

They will be able to stay at foreign worker dormitories, which have isolation and quarantine rooms available. The Government will bear the accommodation cost.

This comes after reports that several landlords have been evicting tenants who have returned from China. 

But so far, there are few employers who have been unable to find a place for their workers, Mr Wong said. 

 

Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, who was also at the site visit, said that the authorities will be stepping up on enforcement measures to make sure both employers and employees stick to LOA and quarantine guidelines.

When asked what these enforcement actions are, Mr Wong said that they will use surveillance measures such as video calls and spot checks, which are already in place to check on those under home quarantine.

Government agencies are working out the penalties for those who fail to follow through on their quarantine or LOA, he added. ",,Workers returning from mainland China to serve mandatory Leave of Absence; S$100 allowance for employers,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ezq8q0/workers_returning_from_mainland_china_to_serve/

It's also less embarrassing than the one our parents and grandparents had where they worried about their lanjiao shrinking due to swine flu. 

""The boy’s problem had started at school, where he’d heard rumors that tainted pork—inoculated against swine fever—could cause koro. Earlier that morning, he’d eaten a steamed bun with pork in it. When he went to urinate, he looked down and felt his penis start to shrink. “Frightened, he quickly grasped the organ and rushed to his parents shouting for help.”

More people followed. Before long the hospitals were flooded with patients. Pork sales plummeted. The Ministry of Primary Production announced that both swine fever and the vaccine were harmless to humans, but the epidemic seemed to accelerate. For seven days it continued, until finally the Singapore Medical Association and the Ministry of Health started appearing on television and radio to announce that suo yang was a purely psychological condition, and that no one had died from it. There was an immediate drop in the number of cases. By November, there were no reports at all.

In the end, a total of 469 cases were recorded, though the real number was certainly higher, since the survey only included Western hospitals and did not account for traditional Chinese doctors. All patients who were interviewed by doctors had heard stories about koro before they experienced it. After the epidemic, the Chinese Physician Association concluded that “the epidemic of Shook Yang was due to fear, rumor mongering, climatic conditions, and imbalance between heart and kidneys….” Meanwhile, a Western-oriented “Koro Study Team,” concluded that koro was “a panic syndrome linked with cultural indoctrination.”

Give  that both Japan and Korea didn’t have strict travel bans on China visitors, the severity of the outbreak should be similar, but Korea is being much worse, these are the possible theories I got after chatting with someone who have worked with Japanese people for more than a decade.

1. With 2020 Tokyo Olympic coming up really soon, the gov in Japan does not want the number to look bad/ severe. Therefore, they are not actively testing suspected cases/ close contacts as compared to Korea. In short, the actual confirmed case number is suppressed greatly. 

2. Japanese people do not like to involve in massive religious gathering in an enclosed space. Given that the most serious outbreak in Korea started with religious gatherings, Japan is relatively safer from it.

3. Japanese people have better hygiene practice in general. Even before the spread of the virus, Japanese generally have better hygiene / social etiquette like wearing masks when they’re sick/ washing hands with alcohol wet tissues etc

With all these said, we both agreed at the end of the convo that sadly, it is a matter of time before massive outbreaks happen in Japan and a travel advisory is issued.

There is no panic among Singaporeans and the ""healthy shouldn't wear masks"" campaign had been so effective that now there is a major social stigma against wearing masks.  

Those wearing masks are ridiculed at schools, get criticized at work and get odd stares on public transport.  So what happens when people, especially the old and vulnerable, have mild symptoms?  They DO NOT WEAR masks because of the social stigma.  We can see this at clinics where patients are coughing/sneezing without masks.  We see this in public transport where people are coughing/sneezing without masks.  We see this in the SAFRA Jurong cluster where people with symptoms go about their work and social activities with no care and no masks.

The situation needs to be righted.  I believe our biggest problem in containing the virus spread in Singapore is getting those with symptoms to wear masks and avoid activities.  Some Ministers and officials can pretend to have symptoms and wear masks in public to show that it's OK to wear masks.

I hope you and your loved ones are well in these extraordinary times.


Few, if any, of us could have imagined a global pandemic like this as country after country bans international travel due to a viral outbreak. While the measures to contain Covid-19 have been taken from a public health perspective, they have crippled the airline industry and presented us at Singapore Airlines with the greatest challenge in our history.


Our customers and staff always remain our top-priority. That principle guided many of our decisions over the last two months as we responded to the increasingly global scale of the outbreak, as well as the growing number of border closures that have decimated air travel.


We know that you trust us to deliver a safe flying experience and ground environment. That is why we modified our in-flight service to reduce the risks to our customers and crew while in the air, and stepped up our cleaning and disinfection procedures both in the aircraft and our ground facilities such as the SilverKris lounges.


Even as we scaled back our operations due to the borders closures, we understood that many of you and your loved ones needed to return home as soon as possible. And you trusted us to make that possible. That is why, despite the fast deteriorating operating economics, we persisted with services to key cities for as long as we could.
We have received many encouraging notes from our customers over the last few weeks. Thank you, your warm words of appreciation mean a great deal to us during this trying time.


At the same time, we also know that many of you have been adversely affected by the large-scale flight cancellations. I sincerely apologise for this.
Our teams have received an unprecedented volume of calls, messages and emails over the last few weeks. While we ramped up the handling capacity at our customer services centres, a few of our overseas contact centre operations were disrupted by government-imposed lockdowns. As a result, we know that we might have caused you considerable frustration and anxiety. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we do everything we can to support your needs, and respond to you as soon as possible.
In view of the uncertainty amid the Covid-19 outbreak, the value of the unused portion of your tickets will be retained as flight credits when your flight has been cancelled or if you would like to postpone your travel. You can use those credits to make a new booking any time from now until 31 March 2021. We have also waived no-show and rebooking fees. Please contact us here when you firm up your new travel plans.



I would also like to share that we will automatically renew all KrisFlyer Elite and PPS Club membership statuses for another 12 months at the end of their membership year. This applies to all memberships expiring from March 2020 through to February 2021. The validity of any expiring PPS and Elite Gold Rewards will also be extended until 31 March 2021.


This is a small token of our appreciation for your loyalty and support, which we value greatly as we work hard to get through this outbreak.
For more than 70 years, SIA has set the standard for in-flight products and services in the aviation industry. It remains unclear when the Covid-19 outbreak will be brought under control. But when it does, you can be sure that we will be ready to welcome you back on board and deliver, once again, the exceptional service that you have come to expect and are familiar with.
Until then, please stay safe and healthy",,Singapore Airline message from CEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fsyur6/singapore_airline_message_from_ceo/

Visited Tiong Bahru Market today to see how the stallholders are doing. I wanted to reassure them of the government’s support, and shared with them the measures we have put in place to help safeguard their livelihoods and well-being amidst the COVID-19 situation. 

One of the new measures we are introducing, to protect both stallholders and patrons, is to require ALL food/drinks handlers at F&amp;B establishments to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers such as face shields. This includes personnel at restaurants, caterers, supermarkets, food courts, coffee shops as well as those in our hawker centres and markets.  
 
From Monday, 13 April, our Enforcement Officers (EOs) and Safe Distancing Ambassadors will ensure F&amp;B employees meet this new requirement, and take enforcement action  such as fines, prosecution and licence suspension against non-compliant establishments. This requirement  will remain beyond the COVID-19 crisis as it is a good practice not just to safeguard public health but also to prevent food contamination. EOs will also continue to remind all F&amp;B employees to stay home if they are unwell. 
 
I have previously shared on how we are helping stallholders with their rental, table-cleaning and central dishwashing fees: (removed the Facebook link)
 
This is a tough time for all our stallholders but with the COVID-19 situation swiftly evolving, it is more important than ever that we upkeep cleanliness and public hygiene. Although we cannot dine in at eating places during this period, do continue to lend your support to our hawker centres and the F&amp;B sector  - patronise their stalls by ordering takeout (bring your own clean containers! ♻️) or delivery. 

We are into our 5th day of circuit-breaker measures, and our actions now will determine whether Singapore successfully contains the outbreak. Do remember to stay home except to go out for essential goods and services. And to keep a safe distance of at least one metre away from the next person when you are out. 

Stay home, and stay safe.

 
今天走访中峇鲁巴刹了解小贩们的情况，并向他们解释政府为了帮助他们维持生计，所给予的支持和措施。

加强清洁卫生是对抗疫情的关键。为了保护摊贩和食客的安全，我们将规定所有在餐饮场所售卖和准备食物或饮料的员工，必须佩戴口罩或面罩。这包括餐馆、餐饮外包服务、超市、食阁、咖啡店，还有所有小贩中心和巴刹的摊贩。这将是长久性的规定，帮助提高卫生标准并确保食物安全。国家环境局正为所有小贩分发可重复使用的口罩。
从4月13日起，我们的执法人员和安全距离大使将确保餐饮业员工遵守这项新规定，并对违规者采取执法行动。执法人员也会继续提醒所有餐饮业员工，若身体不适务必留在家中，不可处理食物。

虽然我们暂时无法在外用餐，但我鼓励大家继续通过打包或外送服务支持我们的小贩中心和餐饮业。打包时请记得自行携带清洁的容器，为环保尽一份力♻️！

新加坡现已进入第五天的阻断措施 -- 我们每个人在日常生活中的行为将决定是否成功遏制疫情。

在此提醒大家： 除非有必要出外购买食物或必需品，不然请待在家中。外出时，与他人保持至少一米的安全距离。

My father says there are long queues waiting to go in so he gave up. I checked that website that monitors mall crowds but the malls nearby are not monitored by it. 

I am feeling anxious about going. For people who have gone to a popular heartland mall/supermarket recently, what is it like? I assume they are taking temperatures but do they take down personal particulars as well?

My mother is working in essential services so I guess I'm probably doomed anyway virus-wise even if I don't go out for groceries. Illogical for me to be anxious right?

I read in his Third World to First book that he decided Singapore should not have a central bank that could issue or expand the monetary supply like other first world countries.

He followed this up by writing that a body (MAS) was created that could only issue Singapore dollars when backed by its equivalent value in foreign exchange.

Correct me if I am wrong, this essentially means the MAS doesn't expand the monetary supply based on internal factors such as through interest rates (and open market operations), but expands the monetary supply based on the exchange rate (external factor).

Lets say the US devalues its currency through quantitative easing and deficit spending because of the pandemic.  As a consequence the Singapore dollar rises relative to USD making the conditions unfavorable for exports.  The MAS would see this change and create new money out of thin air, and sell it on the foreign exchange until the Singapore dollar matches the benchmark for the USD?",,Question about Singapore's monetary policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gduljk/question_about_singapores_monetary_policy/

gij4jy,1589313721,gij4jy,7,,"I’m always a believer in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. I think Singaporean’s response to the COVID situation highlight the importance of STEM education. 

By STEM education, I don’t mean the hard facts about biology to understand the virus or differential calculus to know about the rate which it spreads. I think we need to put a real emphasis on:

1: The scientific method \
2: The process of research and clinical trials \
3: Reading statistics

**The scientific method**

By far the common response to articles announcing new findings by researchers goes something like this: “See, we all know long ago alr, last month we see [phenomenon X] and [phenomenon Y], sure link one! Why are these scientists take so long”

People need to understand that correlation *can, but not necessarily* imply causation. Moreover, researchers need time to gather the raw data, analyse them, and establish the statistical significance between the two. You can’t just have a pen and a pineapple and uh into pen-pineapple-apple-pen. That’s not how it works. The process of gathering these massive amount of data and establishing statistical link is also painfully long and they have to be careful of how they infer the data. 

Using a recent example, I’ve seen many talking about COVID-induced heart complications and why they aren’t counted. Yes we’ve seen a rise in heart complications and researchers are *currently working* on finding the link, you can’t just come to a conclusion that COVID cause heart attack as an outsider without access to those data.

(The point of whether to count them into the death toll is a matter of approaching death toll count and it’s not something I wish to discuss here)

And one key point we absolutely have to note is the rejection of null hypothesis. Scientist can not prove anything. They can only say that the hypothesis is significant to the data. [I’ll let the expert explain](https://youtu.be/bf3egy7TQ2Q)


**Process of research**

*Your anecdotal data isn’t proof of anything.* you need to trust the experts. As someone who went to what people regard as “elite school” and being able to work alongside actual researchers (not medical but you get the idea) under some of the junior programmes offered, I can tell you that their work looks like freaking alien stuff to me. And if you are not exposed to the research field at all, you literally know zero shit about their work. Not saying all research work is reliable but with time and peer reviewing, they usually present a more or less consistent recommendation for the public. Listen to them.

Another point to bring up is people bitching about vaccines taking forever. They need to understand the different phases and the significance of double blind trails. Developing a medication it’s not just feeding someone some chemical, see then recover and be like “he ate my medicine, he recover, therefore my medicine works”. The process to show that your vaccine or medication is safe for consumption and is effecting as a treatment is painfully long, and people need to realise that. 


**Reading Statistics**

Daily infection rates is not the be all and end all. It’s about looking at trends and looking at the context behind those numbers. It’s also important to know what information exactly you are reading from the media. It’s really worrying when people show me curves flattening and say xxx country is doing well on a LOGARITHMIC GRAPH. 

The numbers don’t lie, it’s either the people manipulate the way they present the number to try to cheat you, or you dum dum anyhow interpret to straight up don’t know how to read charts and graphs. 

Many always whine that Singapore’s math and science education is too much emphasis on content and facts, but I think just switching out some of those facts that people not in science professional will use for more real-life and tangible science will make school a little more meaningful.",,COVID highlights the importance of STEM education.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gij4jy/covid_highlights_the_importance_of_stem_education/

i0gpf6,1596088438,i0gpf6,7,,"This is in reference to the recent case regarding MSF, the OP who shared the initial story and the old lady herself.

Now, before I continue with this opinion, I want to caveat my post with the fact that I do think unreservedly that the OP was in the wrong in this whole debacle. Whatever his intentions, he should indeed have looked for formal help or advice, before publicising the issue on social media with his various political slant on it. However, I want to touch on further issues that go beyond what OP said and what the old lady reportedly told him, because now that the online mob is after him (and in some parts the old lady), I do think in general, Singaporeans could do better in empathising with people who fall through the cracks and with people who deem it fit to bring up these issues.  

Firstly, I find it perplexing that to many people, a single MSF update apparently explains everything. It’s as if this particular truth vindicates the mob in trying to justify how all is good and how people (like OP) are just trying to nitpick problems when there aren’t many in the first place. Based on some of the comments I see, apparently living with her son in a 5 room flat with a helper absolves the old lady from all financial struggles, and being a PR justifies her extremely low part time wage right now, without consideration of other factors like her familial relationships. There is no indication that she is not struggling, or of the exact circumstances surrounding the case, and yet people are treating the case like it’s closed and done, as if they know the full facts of the case itself. Now that MSF has stepped in and clarified her condition, surely all was well in the first place and all is going to be good right?

This particular mindset is not new. We see it all the time when statutory boards gives updates after a certain complain (by certain individuals) goes viral, and people’s first response is to attack these individuals for not going through proper channels (or for lying), without consideration of other factors that may have caused this to happen in the first place. As someone in training to be a social worker, this disheartens me terribly. The first thing we learn from our experience in this sector relates to the reasons why so many people refuse to go for help (or are unaware) and hence fall through the cracks. Some are even ineligible, for various reasons despite their immediate needs. We do a disservice to them if we continually ask them why they fall through these cracks instead of trying to fix these cracks ourselves to reach out to them.

More importantly, there is a tendency for which we afford any official updates from official figures as the divine objective truth with regards to personal struggles when personal struggles (financial or otherwise) tend to be subjective to each person’s lived experience. Just because it looks fine, doesn’t always mean everything is fine in real terms.

There is also a tendency to put down people complaining as having exaggerated/ not telling the full truth/ having an agenda, 
when they are obviously complaining from a place of hurt. This does not justify any embellishment in their stories, but it also does not warrant any hurtful comments or aspersions on their character. Imagine if all social workers acted as what the online mob did, when our first response is to beat down the complainer rather than try to empathise. What good do you think this does for our society and for people who fall through the cracks?

I have even seen disgusting comments suggesting that the old lady could have dementia and is faking/exaggerating her poor living situations for god knows what reasons, and comments describing her act as typical of the older generation today.

Like really? Instead of choosing to be empathetic of whatever struggles she is going through, some of which even MSF have confirmed, there are still people accusing her of having a sinister agenda? 

When I first saw the MSF post, the first thing I tried to do was not to poke holes in the old lady’s original story, but to look at issues that may have exacerbated her worries and ignited such a response from her. Immediately, my attention was turned to the fact that her current wage was cut and that one of her son truly perished in a military accident. I cannot even begin to comprehend the build up grief all these years only to end up in a scenario today where she was unable to keep her rice bowl. My understanding of why perhaps she lashed out the way she did (and complained about government not supporting her) was due to her frustration at having to suffer so much in the past, and still not be able to earn a decent income for herself now. She might have thought that she was set for life after the incident, only to find out that was the not the case. Of course, all these are just conjectures, but I hope we understand why it is always important to approach things from other angles instead of the tired and old trodden narrative of complainers always having an axe to grind or be up to no good in order to discredit the government etc.

Which brings me to my next point. Why is it that when people talk about systemic issues and inequalities the first response is always not about discussing these issues, but attacking the people who publicise these issues. OP is obviously in the wrong here, and for many reasons. But so are all the detractors taking away from the discussion initially steered towards discussing systemic problems in this Covid era, where many people are not receiving adequate help and facing issues like unemployment or pay cuts, with the old lady as one such example.

Have we become so thin skinned that when faced with any accusations of problems(whether singular or plural) in our society we immediately become defensive and insist that all that is needed to be done is to go look for formal help? Even Social Workers will tell you that this is not fool-proof despite all their best efforts and intentions.

Why is it that many Singaporeans internalise that a critique of our system is a critique on themselves? Have we become so blinded by the successes of our meritocratic system that any flaws of it must be vehemently protested and dismissed because it destroys our successful narrative?

I do find value in trying to educate OP on what is the proper and acceptable way to seek help for people who are truly in need of help.

But many of the comments I see (despite being supposedly framed to educate him) 
are just self serving and condescendingly smug. 

Regardless of whether OP was in the right or wrong, how are these comments (as seen from Facebook) acceptable? 

Comments asking him if he meant to help, why only offer the old lady 2 dollars? 

Comments gloating at his Facebook post, asking him if he is satisfied now that the old lady reportedly lost her job?

Comments accusing him of making up everything and just seeking clout.

Comments haranguing him for bringing up the minimum wage and how that would have helped the old lady. Note that I think OP should not have brought up (or attacked) any political parties in particular, but I definitely don’t see how and why a discussion on minimum wage cannot be addressed in this particular issue itself.

None of us know OP well enough, and neither has he got any apparent history in activism or social justice. This is not a person who consistently spouted divisive bullshit or has always posted provocatively (unlike some other regular online commentators). This is a person, who at worst, found it triggering to relate to such an experience due to his own perceived biases, and decided to give his own take and rant on it, albeit in a misguided fashion. With the benefit of hindsight, do you think he will make the same mistake again? Bearing in mind that OP actually went down with a volunteer to discern the facts for himself when he could have hid behind the keyboard  (like the “SJW” he was) and pretended nothing happened?

And yet, by the comments floating around, it would seems as though he is the devil incarnate guilty of being the next useless social justice warrior, with his employment and studies all thrown into disrepute as well as being targeted by character assassinations and smears.

Sure, he sounds opinionated, but is it really fair to attack both the messenger and message in such a manner? Is there absolutely a need for this childish version of discourse, where we one-up certain stories and truths such that everyone can pile on the pressure when the ultimate truth is revealed? Is there absolutely no value we can take away from this discussion about people in need, rather than just assuming everything also MSF/the government will settle?

To me, the end result is telling, when OP is willing to be proven wrong despite the personal cost to him, while his detractors just want to be proven right because that justifies their contempt and disgust at OP for daring to do what he did.

Because tell me, why do we have to make it sound as though somebody won/ the truth prevailed when nobody is the winner here? The old lady has reportedly lost her job, OP is under tremendous heat for not clarifying in the first place, folks from MSF have to work overtime, and everything good from the discussion about systemic problems (some of which are legitimate) are just thrown out of the window. 

I fear for our discourse when we view complex life struggles in such a black and white fashion. OP was in the wrong for attempting to generalise and internalise his own biases onto a very specific situation. 

Let’s not make the same mistake and sweep away all the good discussion (some of which I saw online regarding systemic problems) just because of one specific situation that we do not have full access to the facts. Let’s continue to be reminded that there are many people in similar plight as the old lady and many more people who fall through the cracks and let’s be more empathetic to their struggles, no matter what channels they may take to vent their frustrations. 

Note: I think I’ve had enough internet for the day. I’m going to take a break from this and come back to this post later at night or tomorrow. So if you comment, I’m sorry if I do not reply you. Still, feel free to discuss among yourselves in a civil manner. I’m sure we can all do that at the very least.

I have a few questions in my mind when I saw this on the website and I was hoping if someone could shed some light on them.

What are the techniques used by officials when gathering information and what is the verification process like when assessing the reliability of collected information? Do people actually check the original source when looking at the news or is it simply a medium where news outlets recycle information from their reputable counterparts?

What makes a source unreliable? Who does the verification for all the videos posted on various media platforms? (e.g. videos from people living in Wuhan currently) How is the process like?

Do news outlets actually bother to validate/confirm the citations made in articles or is it assumed to be accurate the moment there is a citation made from the originating article? Who verifies the originating article (the source) then? (Example: The Eight Spiders)

He is in Muay Thai and he said that he wants to go for a competition that ppl is randomly chosen based on balloting. I advised him to focus on the assignment on task since the deadline is nearing. 

Guess what? He suddenly became pissed at me and said that I was implying he doesn't give a shit about his studies. I thought I might have phrased my sentence wrongly but I definitely felt that he was being too childish to react like that.

The govt may want to control the virus without tanking the economy but I think that's impossible now. Even if our businesses are open, we still get affected if business partners overseas are in shut down. Some like SIA can't operate because there is really no demand. Entertainment venues are closing and the 16sq m rule is basically a death blow for retail. 

So basically while businesses may not be fully dead, they are like walking dead. In this case, we might as well lock down 1 month and get it over with.

The main problem with lockdown is the economic impact. To solve this, we can go ...ahem... tripartite.

Employees have to take 1 week no pay leave. The balance wage bill is split between govt and employer. To help employers further, maybe the can defer CPF contributions for the lockdown month and pay back by installments for rest of the financial year.

Singapore unintentionally saw the rise of coronavirus infections in migrant workers. Most of them are young and aged between 20-40 years.

Despite number of infections going into thousands, the fatalities are zero in this younger age group.

That means the country could be opened and put heavy restrictions on vulnerable population. We also have to separate  people with high viral load so that miller strain of the virus survives.

i14g67,1596187006,i14g67,8,,"Hey all, 

Some background first: recently I have been going back to teach my primary school cousin tuition at my aunty’s house. The thing is, because we live in the same HDB block with several other family members, sometimes they would just come over to my aunty’s house to hang out. 

I have this other partially autistic cousin (who’s about 40+ years old) who understandably almost completely lacks social awareness. He doesn’t want to wear a mask. Any attempts to make him wear a mask or cover his mouth causes him to react aggressively. My aunties have resorted to just barely acknowledging his existence as he constantly badgers anyone non stop who pays him attention (like looking through your stuff/ asking rly inane questions for hours). My aunty normally just lets him in to her house for him to read the papers etc. she tried locking him out before but he would persistently bang the doors and shout a lot until she responded. 

I don’t think they want to commit him into IMH because they still see him as family. But still it’s pretty troubling.

The main point though is that this guy has been coughing non stop for the past month or 2. Recently, like the past 2-3 weeks, he comes to my aunty’s house a lot and just coughs like a fish out of water, attempts again to ask him to cover his mouth or wear a mask are useless. Yet he comes and coughs and coughs like as though he swallowed thorns or sth, my aunties have resorted to just staying away from him when he coughs. 

So here’s the problem: It’s quite scary because he doesn’t wear a mask, so I’m not sure if he does so when he walks around etc. (probably not Lel) so idk if he has actually caught Covid yet only possesses the milder symptoms. If so my entire aunty’s family and myself are at risk. 

Yet again because he’s autistic I’m not sure if he can be held responsible or accountable for such behaviour. Additionally, any attempt apart from coercive action would seem to fail. 

I haven’t developed any covid symptoms despite teaching my primary school cousin for about a month(?) yet I’m concerned for my aunties and kiddo cousin.

""""$675.. in 4-hour shifts (or about $6.50 an hour)"" That works out to 26 shifts of 4 hours each. Even worse than Bianca Skold's guess of 23 working days, it seems to work out to 6 days a week for $26 a day. The $6 extra that makes the difference between $5 and $6.50 an hour? Is it that she counts the extra time needed to travel there and get ready? Is it some additional allowance that she might be given for meals perhaps? (Allowances are officially included under ""gross wages"") Is it that some days she is paid more and some days it is $5/hr? I am now less sure that she was ""lying"".

MSF also mentioned that prior to Covid, she was able to work longer hours and earn $1300/mo. Taking the same $6.50/hr and 26 shifts would come to 7.7 hours, which doesn't quite work out. So it's probably 8 hours at slightly less hourly plus some additional component. $5.50/hour + $2 subsidy per meal? $5/hr + $2 for breakfast + $4 each for lunch and dinner? Just my blind guess as someone who knows next to nothing about this. But now I can see that the numbers might not really disagree at all.""

I am considering a longer trip to Singapore in January, but I am not sure how enjoyable that would be amidst the coronavirus outbreak.

So before I proceed any further with the process of being legally admitted to the country, I would ask you the following question: **What restrictions have you been feeling in the last couple of months as a result of COVID-19 regulations?** 

This includes restrictions in all areas, for example: restrictions in everyday activities, sports, hobbies, social gatherings, basically anything that you feel you used to be able to do but now unfortunately cannot. And by ""cannot"", I mean it would breach laws/regulations.

I am also curious whether the cost of living went up or not. 

You can also share any expectations you might have about the situation for 2021.

eyjksa,1580786811,eyjksa,9,,"Sheez there are so many people here who are confusing LOA vs Quarantine. Anyway here is the government's explanation:

 

There is a difference between an LOA and a Quarantine Order (QO).

A QO is served to healthy individuals who have a higher risk of  exposure to the virus, such as someone who has close contact with an  infected person.  QOs have legal force, with severe penalties for  non-compliance. Quarantine usually occurs in the home but can also be  served in dedicated Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) or  hospitals, should the individual not have suitable accommodation in  Singapore.

An LOA is also issued to students and staff who are healthy, but have  recently travelled to Mainland China. So it is a precautionary measure.  Although LOAs are not legally binding, we strongly urge those on LOA to  be socially responsible and comply with the LOA, to prevent possible  transmission of infections.

The students and staff on LOAs are not required to stay at home and  be isolated at all times. During the LOA, students and staff are  expected to:

&amp;#x200B;

* Remain contactable at all times
* Remain in the place of residence as much as possible
* Minimise visitors to the place of residence
* Minimise time spent in public places and contact with others
* Monitor their health and their temperature
* (For Students) Follow their home-based learning plan closely to continue with their learning

We could have been more candid as these are exceptional and unexpected times and mistakes can and expected to be made. So what did we do right and what did we do wrong and I am happy to take your suggestions and questions. 

1. Firstly we should have studied the impact of going Orange a lot better. a colour coded escalation status works well in the Army and trained uniformed services where they are actually trained in the various escalation steps and know what to do. The same cannot be said of the general public. We will probably have to do lots of work on it and have a clear separate scheme for the public. The leak was regrettable as it gave the impression that a select group of people were given undue advantage. We are looking at the leak seriously. 
2. We got the Health care sector absolutely right and we are proud of it. Lessons learnt from SARS helped us immensely. We were fighting this at the forefront at every age and the staff knew it. NCID officially opened last year and it is World class purpose built facility just for this and we should publicise this. The reputation of Singapore's Heathcare is well known and the recent endorsement by Harvard and WHO speaks volumes. MHA has also been brilliant in helping us with contact tracing. We could have done a better job with the media on our state of the art facilities in NCID and its sad that one of our patients a Chinese National did an excellent vlog on it which has gone viral. We, the local media failed but it took a foreigner who we were treating to showcase us. 
3. We got it wrong with our major retailers. We should have advised them on placing limits rather than show empty shelves, long queues and overpacked trolleys which will fuel a panic. We were 4 days late. It is a good lesson for us and the retailers. It was obvious they were waiting for our cue to act. 
4. We have an excellent stockpile scheme for daily essentials and this is legislated by law. It works very well and there was never going to be a shortage but we failed to engage the media to publicise it which made the situation even worse. We only mentioned it on the later part of the second day. 
5. The mask however was another issue and we could not guarantee supply. We learnt a serious lesson from this and the our Civil Servants have been tasked to start from a scratch on a new plan for health and safety equipment for the public including new specific laws  on profiteering and hoarding across the Board and across as all possible emergency scenarios. We also failed to address the price control issue. Only one notice was served by MTI in the first few days for alleged profiteering when it so widespread. It gave the impression that we were disconnected from the group and I suspect we were. 
6. So who are the guilty parties. I would say all of us including the Govt for failing to provide leadership and good panning in some of the areas. It also shows graciousness is a luxury. In a crisis if not handled well it goes out the door faster than any other personal attributes. So there is work to be done to recover this.",,"Ok lah, I screwed up and this is what I should have said instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f7be53/ok_lah_i_screwed_up_and_this_is_what_i_should/

So much so, that in Singapore I've been seeing two sides of the coin on a daily basis. I've seen people who rush at the earliest indication of a worsening situation to buy an unnecessary amount of groceries and provisions. I've seen people sharing every bit of information they can access about the pandemic to their families and friends, regardless of its accuracy or credibility. I've seen people also sharing posts and videos, that not only contain no factual information, but that are designed to fear monger those who watch it. 

However, I've also seen large gatherings of students in public places after school. I've seen people who are sick, and travel on public transport without a face mask. I've overheard people talking about other countries, and how their situation is markedly worse than Singapore's ""as their country doesn't manage these things well"" or ""because their government doesn't know how to handle"". 

Both what Dr. Balakrishnan and PM Lee said during their CNBC interview and National Address, respectively, should resonate strongly with us as a nation. 

As Singaporean citizens, PRs, or residents, we are extremely fortunate that our government, healthcare services, and workers who are dealing with the pandemic, have been able to guide us in handling the COVID-19 situation in the best way possible. 

Whilst we are currently being held in high regard for our country's management of this outbreak since it began at the tail-end of 2019, we cannot let this be a reason for us to become complacent. We have been able to effectively approach COVID-19 due not only to our infrastructure, but also to our actions as individuals. 

Our government's advisory has lead us on the best path so far to combating the severity of this pandemic, and whilst we should be confident in their abilities to guide us going forward, we must always remember that each of us contributes to combating this virus effectively. It is up to us to play our part and work together with each other to continue Singapore's effective management of COVID-19.

Whatever demographic you may be, take care of your personal hygiene, and be respectful of it to those around you. Practice social distancing, even if you are young and are feeling well, because even if you carry COVID-19 but do not show any symptoms, by going out to public common spaces, you could transmit to someone who is much more susceptible to the virus than you are. Always check news sources to ensure information is factual and correct. Do not share media if it does not come from a credible source.

We have been able to set an example to the world on how to combat this virus, so let us all continue to work together to keep ourselves safe, well informed, and prepared for whatever may come by taking a rational and sensible approach to new information as it becomes available to us.

This allows them to disappear off the world stage and avoid responsibility and media attention for the massive amount of suffering, death, and financial loss of so many.

I have never been much of a conspiracy person but the sad reality that there is more than a fair share of evidence about the lab in Wuhan and COVID-19 is damning enough.

On top of that Wuhan, the wet markets, and over all China have been a problem when it comes to Viruses for quite some time.

After this is all over and the amount of sheer death and misery this has brought I hope it is never forgotten that China is responsible.

I do look forward to this outing. But I am questioning myself, out of morals and rationality, if I should cancel this outing. If I look at this strictly from a rational point of view, then I definitely should reduce chances of contracting and spreading the virus by NOT going.

My experience is based on a non-medical mask but a branded 'fashion' mask called **Pitta**. These may or may not have an effect in keeping out viruses but that is not my point now.

Pitta mask is a very popular mask from **Japan**. These are used in the pre-Corona times to keep out pollen during the Spring and Summer seasons.

Pitta is branded, stylish but relatively more expensive than the usual mask. What I like about Pitta is, it **breathes easy** via its sponge-like material. These make Pitta a prime target for counterfeit production, trying to opportune the market share.

There are many **made in China fake** Pitta masks going around. Anyone could order these in bulk from Tao Bao or Ali. Some of these people who buy in bulk may not even know at first that these are fake, and sell them innocently.

As wearing of masks will be wide-spread now, it'll start to become a **lifestyle** or a fad, as least for next 6-12 months. Many will start to see people wearing these nice looking masks and want to buy from Carousell, Shopee, etc.

If you wish to get a Pitta:

\- Do google on 'real fake Pitta' and you will see examples of the fake ones. Ask the sellers to show you a live photo of their masks as many will just use professional photos in their listing.

\- Its fairly **easy to spot the fakes** just from the outside packaging.

gkpouv,1589608906,gkpouv,9,,"I’ve just gotten back to using Facebook a couple of months back. I mostly view news from news pages and frankly it’s really shocking how some Singaporean’s mindsets are in the comments section. Whenever an article is posted, or at least 90% of articles, the comment sections are filled with so much negativity and ignorance. It disappoints me how so many Singaporean’s lack appreciation for Singapore and how ignorant they are.

For example, I recently saw an article that was posted about Singapore having recently developed a test kit that could detect covid-19 within an hour. However, singaporean’s instead of being appreciative was negative/pessimistic and reacted negatively in the comments section be it factual or just plain bs (do note that these negative comments accounted for like 95% of that specific comment section.)

Another example would be an article I saw that was in relation to entertainment news. The comment section was just bombarded with comments on how the news page was not posting about “real news” and trying to divert attention away from covid-19 (in a manner which made it seem like the news outlet was trying to hide covid-19 these comments made up the majority of the comment section) and ranting about Singapore’s current situation which had no relation to the news article whatsoever. In my head i was just thinking to myself how ignorant some singaporean’s are. Honestly, it doesn’t take much to realise that news outlets not only report on current affairs/world news but also news related to entertainment.

Lastly, articles about singapore’s covid-19 situation. Often times i see the comment sections being bombarded with so much negativity and hate about how this could be better, that could be better, why can’t we take care of our foreign workers etc. Yet they fail to realise that Singapore’s government has been doing so much to help Singaporean’s as compared to other countries. Look at how many country’s healthcare system have collapsed under the strain of covid-19 while we’re still doing well. This wasn’t by luck, this took meticulous planning and foresight by the government to be able to set up a healthcare system that is more effecient then most other countries, if not the most efficient. About the foreign workers situation, I agree that there are things to be worked on. But if improvements were to be made would Singaporean’s actually be receptive or are they comment stuff like “Even construction workers are being treated better than Singaporean’s”. Personally, i feel that many singaporean’s are just using the current situation on construction workers to rant about Singapore’s government rather than actually caring for them.

In conclusion, the ignorance, negativity and the lack of appreciation shown by so many Singaporean’s is just disappointing.

hm8cqp,1594044715,hm8cqp,9,,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Enforcing a fake news law in the run up to a national election, authorities in Singapore have ordered that online references to some comments made by opposition figures on key issues must carry a warning that the content contains false information.

Rights groups have long-warned that the law, which came into effect last year and has repeatedly been directed at opposition figures, may be used to silence criticism of the government ahead of the July 10 vote.

Since campaigning began on July 1, opposition candidates have been taken to task under the law over comments made on three issues; government spending for foreign students, plans to grow the city-state’s 5.7 million population to 10 million, and government advisories that discouraged COVID-19 testing for foreign workers.

Concerns about immigration and jobs have dominated discussion during the campaigning as the city state faces its deepest ever recession due to the coronairus pandemic.

As yet, no lawmakers from the ruling People’s Action Party - which has governed since independence in 1965 - have been served correction orders.

The government has denied suggestions that the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) could be used to stifle opposition, and says the law does not curb legitimate criticism or restrict free speech. The POFMA office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Government ministers usually have the power to exercise the law, but during the election period this responsibility has been handed to senior civil servants.

Under the law, authorities can order political parties, news outlets and social media users to carry warnings that their pages or posts contain false statements, and to include links to a government fact-checking website.",,Singapore's fake news law trips up opposition as election looms,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hm8cqp/singapores_fake_news_law_trips_up_opposition_as/

hp31mi,1594437720,hp31mi,9,,"#What the PAP has done wrong:

- Made a number of controversial political maneuvers in the past five years, which includes amendments to the constitution for the presidential election system.
- Had a wrong grip on the mood surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Like Chan Chun Sing mentioned in the leaked audio clip, they had wanted to rely on a ""crisis"" to increase votes for the establishment based on a sense of urgency.
- Made a number of mistakes in statements and speeches during the campaign, including the use of language that could be easily misunderstood and taken out of context. This includes attacks on the opposition that many would deem to be lacking in class.
- Made an overly bold move in leadership succession by introducing a record number of new candidates in an uncertain election
- Portrayed itself in an underwhelming manner with candidates who have had questionable history and attitude, thus creating an image of an elitist party filled with top men and women who struggle to show that they can relate to the people, even though they have strong qualifications and portfolios

#What the opposition has done right:

- Solid campaigning that did not stray from its emphasis on the people, not engaging in petty war of words
- You have to give it to Singapore Democratic Party's Chee Soon Juan for not repeating his past mistakes of making controversial remarks that the PAP preyed upon 
- Good quality candidates from Workers' Party
- Retirement of key Workers' Party members which instilled a sense of urgency for the survival of opposition parties

#Other factors that worsened the blunders from PAP:

- The anti-establishment sentiments on social media and the Internet is greater than what I would have anticipated in a regular scenario. In the three weeks leading up to the General Election 2020, the social media was set ablaze with all manners of one-sided criticisms of the People's Action Party, ""memes"", and praises for even some of the dark horse opposition candidates. I do not wish to dismiss entirely the movement of the people to give the PAP a ""wake up call"", but the extent to which this has happened is what I found to be worthy of a close look.
- The leaking of the Chan Chun Sing audio clips. This has happened twice. The manner in which the audio clips have been cut to remove context, the ways they have been recorded and leaked online are what I found to be highly irregular. 
- The leak first happened in the **Chinese Chamber for commerce**. The second time happened during a closed-door meeting of PAP supporters. This to me, reflects a coordinated effort to damage the image of Chan Chun Sing. The damage is of course in part caused by Chan Chun Sing's personal carelessness in speech, he bears responsibility in this. However, I do not think that such a coordinated act is something that the Singapore opposition parties would do
- Against the backdrop of the various foreign state sanctioned activities in Singapore during the past two election terms, it is my opinion that the active involvement of certain foreign state actors in the most recent General Election is highly probable

I had previously made such an observation regarding geopolitics

&gt;Singapore has always been in the middle of the US and China, and leans slightly toward the US where core security implications are concerned.

&gt;I believe that ties between Singapore and China have been strained significantly in the past five years due to a number of factors.

&gt;1. China has become more aggressive in projecting its influence under President Xi Jinping and has begun to expect more from Singapore. It feels that Singapore should re-calibrate its ties between US and China now that China is a much stronger country.
&gt;2. Singapore has always maintained unofficial military ties with Taiwan, which saw Singapore troops training in Taiwan each year. No other countries have been allowed this privilege, and with the current Taiwan administration being strongly anti-China, China has pressured Singapore to cut ties with Taiwan.
&gt;3. Singapore had also taken the stance of supporting a rule-based, international law governed order in the South China Sea. This stance annoyed China and led it to question its relationship with Singapore.
&gt;4. Ultimately, China decided to punish Singapore, and this took the form of  the detainment of Singapore owned armoured vehicles that were returning from Taiwan to Singapore through shipment. Chinese authorities notified the Hong Kong customs to detain the shipment which caused great tension between the two countries. The incident was ultimately resolved by shifting all of the blame onto the ship captain who China accused of ""failing his paperwork"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrex_ICV#Incidents
&gt;5. By that time, ties between Singapore and China had fallen to its lowest in decades. Singapore's Prime Minister visited China multiple times in a year to bring relations back on track. Relations have since returned to normal, but it should be expected that China is becoming less trustful of Singapore ever since.
&gt;6. In the past several years, a number of hacking attacks happened. These were identified by the Singapore government to be state supported hacking attacks and were targeted at stealing information on the Prime Minister, health records and other data were targeted https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_SingHealth_data_breach
&gt;7. Even more recently, a man named HuangJing was accused to being a foreign agent and was expelled from Singapore. He was a Chinese American academic who had tried to hand over secret information to the Singapore government in order to sway its strategic decision-making. He was widely believed to be a Chinese agent, with a just-retired Singapore diplomat musing about why the man was allowed to retain American citizenship even while holding influential Chinese positions on the national newspaper. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Jing_(academic)

&gt;Many have the misconception of China being extremely friendly to Singapore. That has not been the case behind-the-scenes for the last five to ten years at least. It is thus extremely possible that the current China is unsatisfied with its Singapore ties and is looking for every opportunity it can find to expand its influence. 

&gt;I would not rule out the possibility of China expanding its influence operations such as spying, hacking, economic pressure, and at worst direct interference of Singapore politics by manipulating news or the supporting of alternative political forces. As is the common knowledge in influence-driven regime change (not unfamiliar to the US), ""If you are unable to sway a person, you strive to replace that person with another""

&gt;It is imperative that people from Singapore keep an eye out for foreign operations in its politics, as a number of foreign powers seem to be shifting up their gears such areas.

All in all, this is a post to review and to analyse what has gone wrong for the PAP, right for the opposition parties (credits to them), and most importantly, external factors. I have but one simple point which I would like to put attention on - **regardless of who you vote for or support, remember that Singapore's brand of politics is for Singaporeans first. Always be cautious and discerning of decisions with long term geopolitical implications. Let your eyebrows be raised if anybody ( PAP and opposition alike) makes suspicious propositions (such as cutting of Taiwanese military ties, stance on South China Sea, military alignment etc, you know what I mean)** 

Prioritisation of Singapore's interests ensures Singapore's survival even if the PAP were to lose more ground or if the government were to change.

**There’s one and a half page on CDCs in ST which are really platforms for Mayors to say what they are doing. They should each take out an ad. They read like constituency broadcasts. I am not convinced about the importance of their work and terribly annoyed by the lack of hard questions. So there is an overarching piece on the role. Let’s talk a look. Consider this a free tutorial if you like.**

When rolling out initiatives for residents, sometimes size matters.
**(With this, I would want to know what is the size of the CDC, and what sort of resources – money, staff - it has compared to say East Coast GRC which is rolling out the East Coast plan)**

That is why mayors, who helm districts that cover large areas, can pull together resources and roll out initiatives that may be a stretch for MPs in their constituencies.
**(Above is NOT an explanation about why size matters)**

They are also able to quickly to pick up on emerging needs and implement solutions quickly and more nimbly, said the five newly sworn-in mayors in interviews with The Straits Times.
**(Now I want to know why they can do so quicker than say the CCC or those managing community centres, or GRC MPs)**

Ms Denise Phua, Ms Low Yen Ling and Mr Desmond Choo have been reappointed, while Mr Alex Yam and Mr Fahmi Aliman are new to the job.
**(Basic background above although it would be good to know who has been longest-serving.)**

Ms Phua, mayor of Central Singapore District, said people often have questions about the role of mayors and Community Development Councils (CDC).
**(Yes….)**

First, mayors identify the needs of residents, she said. They bring together resources and tap a network of corporate allies, social service agencies and others. Then, they create and roll out initiatives to meet residents' needs, she added.
**(Again, this is NOT an answer. It’s basic SOP  to identify needs, marshall resources and roll out initiatives)**

Mr Choo, serving a second term as North East District mayor, said they can take a broader perspective on resources and what is needed on the ground. For example, tertiary students who rely on casual jobs have struggled during the pandemic as there are no banqueting jobs and fewer part-time roles at cafes.
**(You mean if not CDC, then cannot see that tertiary students are struggling with part-time job search?)**

""We are able to see these needs, and able to create pilots quickly and tackle problems. It took us six weeks, from firstly encountering the problem, assessing it, putting together a sum of money, to then rolling it out,"" said Mr Choo.
**(Six weeks is quick? I suppose so. But what’s the discussion about? And how much in total from the CDC?)**

North East CDC's Tertiary Student Transport Scheme provides $150 or $300 to eligible students.
**(Is this the outcome? Total surprise – was thinking they helping to roll out jobs rather than deciding on a handout. So how much given in the end?)**

When CDCs were first formed in 1997, they provided social and employment assistance, said Ms Low. These functions were later given to the Ministry of Social and Family Development, and Workforce Singapore - then known as the Singapore Workforce Development Agency.
**(So why is the North East CDC giving social assistance here? And if you read the individual stories, plenty of job fairs stuff they also do…Also, story doesn’t say that CDCs complement the move towards bigger GRCs – like the six-member ones of old)**

But some aspects of CDCs remain unchanged, said Ms Low. These include their ability to respond quickly to a crisis, such as Sars and the global financial crisis, as well as to galvanise local support.
**(Ability to respond to a crisis as compared to what? Seems to me its just a middle layer of bureaucracy.)**

Also unchanged is their role to promote social cohesion in multiracial and multicultural Singapore, and deliver social and community programmes for vulnerable families in the district, she added.
When needed, the five CDCs, which each runs its own initiatives, come together to launch nationwide programmes, such as the CDC Vouchers Scheme and Student Meal Scheme amid the Covid-19 pandemic, said Ms Low, who is chairman of the mayors' committee. Their flexibility allows them to give out assistance faster than state aid from the Government, which tends to be more careful, given that tax dollars are involved, she added.
**(What does this mean? The PA already has an extensive grassroot network on the ground. Isnt this the job of the grassroots committees?)**

When the mayors developed the Student Meal scheme, they discussed plans daily via Zoom for about 10 days, said Ms Phua. ""The beauty of the CDC is that we have some flexibility in this middle office, to build and tap the vast corporate and ground network that we have in our districts, and respond... in a more nimble and responsive way, of course always within our resources and constraints.""
**(Blithering bureaucracy. What flexible? What tap on vast corporate network? What nimble and responsive? All just words with no specifics attached)**

Mayors and CDCs are no replacement for the role played by MPs and grassroots advisers, and ministries and other help groups on the ground. Instead, CDCs play a supporting and connecting role, like an ""invisible hand"", said Ms Phua.
**(Ahah! But has the article said why no replacement? Is it merely because CDCs have a pot of money to play with? Can Social Service Offices and CCCs do the same? Or the MPs getting together under town council? Or as part of a GRC. And why do you need MPs to head CDCs then? It’s a $660,000 a year job! Why not get someone who specialises in such work rather than politicians? Why not making it a gigantic subset of the PA – which it is actually. And do Opp MPs ever get to serve as Mayors? What if they win a few more adjacent constituencies? )**

Mr Fahmi, a newly elected MP, said he wondered at first how he could connect with stakeholders in his constituency. ""When I stepped into the CDC, I realised they have all this information. They're very connected with all the stakeholders, corporate partners, schools, services.""
**(Stakeholders are who leh??? Vampire-killers?)**

Cultivating relationships and linking up those who need help with the right resources on his own would have been ""a bit tough"" since he is new to the job, said Mr Fahmi.
**(I am terribly surprised. So if no CDC, got no data? Previous MPs asleep? Computer malfunction? And did he really think he would have to use his MP allowance?)**

Mr Yam said the CDC, at its best, plays the role of an enabler, helping those on the ground with initiatives by providing resources and a wide network of partners.
**(For heavens sake! Be specific!)**
""So for us, it's not a matter of too many people using our resources. That's always a happy problem. What we don't want is a situation where people don't understand or are not aware of the schemes that we have, and therefore they're underutilised,"" he added.
**(But we don’t even know how many people use the resources!!!) **",,Bertha henson FB post on mayors,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j34cw9/bertha_henson_fb_post_on_mayors/

I will be traveling to Singapore in the middle of March. I hold a Canadian Passport but my wife holds a Korean Passport with Canadian Permanent Residency. She hasn't been to Korea in over one year as we both live in Canada. 

She's a bit worried with the corona-virus situation of not being able to enter through immigration in Singapore just by having a Korean passport.  I'm pretty certain this won't be the case and my understanding is, even if Singapore were to enact a travel ban on South Korea, it would only be for those who have been to the country or infected parts of the country.

Nevertheless, it's still a big victory for the WP and in the words of Low Thia Kiang, a ""tight slap in the face for PAP"".

Opposition percentages at the various GRCs are closer than ever, and we will have more voices in parliament, but I do think a cautious optimism will be needed even with LHL declaring Pritam Singh the official opposition leader. The West Coast GRC was 'rigged' to include the strong PAP segments from Tanjong Pagar and Hong Kah, and I think the PAP victory came from shrewd planning. For Sengkang, the WP had a boost in the form of the attention being on East Coast and I would say they used the diversion to go all in on Sengkang. I can bet my very last dollar that we're going to see some redrawings of the Sengkang boundaries and the heat will be on the WP then.

As for PSP and Tan Cheng Bock, they do have some outstanding credentials but I'm not too hopeful over their chances when TCB steps down. A closer look at the various SMC results also shows that while we are inching towards more opposition voices, Singaporeans have also indicated a general dislike for the strong, hard-hitting styles of Chee Soon Juan and Lim Tean. I must say I was abit disappointed that neither of them got into parliament. As constructive as the Workers' Party is, I do not really recall them going all out on certain matters like the hepatitis outbreak and what not, and perhaps it is a conscious decision by them to maintain an amicable opposition image, and they are unlikely to deviate too much from this winning formula.

End of the day even with much lower votecount, PAP has only lost an additional GRC and it's probably not even much of a pain point for them. Ng Chee Meng and Lam Pin Min feel easily replaceable and probably will get a cushy GLC job after. I would also caution against being 'taken in' by PM Lee's gesture of declaring Pritam Singh the official opposition leader. It was just days ago that the PAP launched a smear campagin against Raeesah Khan and I don't think that internal mindset has changed at all. 

All in all, it's a major milestone for the Workers' Party and a step forward for politics in Singapore, but the need to stay on this narrow path beset with so many bumps cannot be emphasized enough.",,"One small step for democracy in Singapore, amid a long road ahead",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hp58bt/one_small_step_for_democracy_in_singapore_amid_a/
hp605y,1594452570,hp605y,10,,"**Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herewith are strictly mine as a private citizen and has nothing to do with my employer, the National University of Singapore.**

The results for this GE were somewhat within my expectations, except I wasn’t expecting Seng Kang GRC to be lost to WP. But it was a close call. 

I am glad to see that my Opposition supporter friends are happy. While the loss of Seng Kang  GRC would shock some PAP supporters, it does not provoke quite as much anger overall compare to the scenario where PAP swiped all the seats (which was not impossible).

On the other hand, if PAP had lost either East Coast or West Coast GRC, #die. 

I consider this a good outcome for the country. 

**Natural evolution of the system, hardly landmark.** 

Some had claimed that this was going to be some landmark GE and there’s this huge swing against the PAP. I disagree.

If we look at the voting trends over the past 2 decades, it would be clear that the Opposition has been gaining ground steadily over the past 2 decades. 2015 was an anomaly. Everyone (PAP and Opposition) all knew that it was the “LKY Effect.”

What we have seen this GE is that “LKY Effect” has worn out, and the fact that the vote share has gone up a little higher than in 2011, suggests that there’s still some amount of “flight to safety” given the COVID19 crisis (maybe?).

In any case, vote share is also not a good measure of the population’s approval of the PAP because it should also be clear that there is a large segment of “swing” voters in Singapore who do not fully identify with any Party (which is a v v good thing). 

The quality of the candidate actually matters for some and people do not just vote along party lines. I consider this a feature and not a bug. We will have serious polarization if everyone just blindly picks a side. It is this group of middleground “swing” voters who are the real check on the Government. If our politics goes the way of the US, we are doomed. Furthermore, we are seeing more and better quality Opposition candidates during this latest GE, so PAP’s vote share will naturally drop also (as long as voters are not polarized along party lines). 

**Holding the Middleground**

Let me be v blunt. These middleground “swing” voters are the real checks on the Government, not Opposition MPs.

If we divorce the politics from the actual governance, our public policy making is still v sound. The Opposition will not be able to bring anything new to the table. All the proposals they suggest would have already been considered. Where the Government is found wanting is the inability, or perhaps lack of willingness (basically cannot be bothered), to explain to the people. I could probably have done it singlehandedly except nobody is paying me to do it. 📷:-) 

Policy innovation happens occasionally, but it is extremely rare. Think COE and Progressive Wage Model (PWM). Workfare was not bad, but it’s not entirely innovative in my view. 

If I am right, then the natural question is: why do we need politicians? Why don’t we just get rid of the whole bunch of them and save taxpayers money like the Opposition seems to suggest.  After all, the civil service can more or less keep the country running? 

The problem with good governance is that it is like bad-tasting (good) medicine. What is good for the country at large will probably not be popular. 

Because money does not grow on trees, the Government has to decide where and how to spend our tax dollars. The civil servants do a lot of work to make projections and analyze the various options. I have no doubts that our public servants do their best. This also their country. They also don’t want to screw it up. However because money is finite, some trade off will need to be made and some segment of the population will be unhappy. So, what is the job of the politicians?

To hold the ground and ensure that the Government has the **moral authority** to make hard decisions. PAP politicians, you had that one(!) job. :’(

Given how politics has been evolving in the US, my fear for this country is polarization, as people start to take sides and politics becomes tribal. I hope that people will stay centred.  Just because PAP is fronting some unpopular policy don’t assume that they are wrong; if the Opposition is touting something that sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Please all watch this [video](https://youtu.be/fLJBzhcSWTk). 

**Repentance Not Yet Forthcoming**

It was terrible for the PAP that the call for “repentance” leading to the loss of Aljunied GRC in 2011 was largely forgotten after the LKY Effect in 2015. 

It is a mystery to me why the PAP doesn’t seem to have figured out that a heavy-handed and bullying form of politics does not work with the modern electorate. 

The Constitutional amendments for the Presidential Elections was v ugly. It boggles my mind why the PAP would want to burn precious political capital. If TCB was allowed to become President (he is more or less a harmless old man. People think he wouldn’t agree to allow Government to tap reserves for COVID meh?), the PAP also wouldn’t have had to contend with PSP and almost risk losing West Coast GRC. 

Amendments to the NCMP scheme were actually quite benign. Essentially, the political system is just evolving into something that is closer to [Proportional Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation), which I actually think is a good thing. If some 30% of the population supports the Opposition and there are only 5 Opposition MPs, something also doesn’t seem right lah. Unfortunately, the PAP went to politicize it by saying that people no longer have to vote for the Opposition.

I also thought that POFMA was a mistake. I initially supported POFMA because fake news is a real threat to democracy. Unfortunately, implementation is policy and the clumsy manner in which POFMA has been exercised has not won the PAP too many fans. My main concern about fake news would be instances where people spread fake news that can cause riots and social unrest, but unfortunately, in those instances, it does not seem POFMA goes far enough. In my view, POFMA isn’t working. The Government should go and review it and either repeal it or amend it in some way, so that it actually achieves some good.

Sadly, I don’t think that the PAP has improved on its brand of politics since 2011. In fact, I believe that it has gotten worse since 2015. :’( 

It’s cool to be a prof ‘cos I get to chat with these young people all the time and they teach this dinosaur many new things. Thank you. Anyhow, there was this boy (he’s not \*that\* young anymore. Just always young to me), who was sharing me these really insightful observations. So naturally, I asked him, “wow, you can be the next wonderboy for the PAP!”

He was incredulous. He told me that I must be kidding. He said to me that while PAP is doing a decent job, it’s brand is so bad that it’s unsalvageable.  The PAP might want to chew on this feedback. 

In this current day and age, talent is king. WP has managed to build a really formidable video team for this GE. Kudos to them. If the PAP does not clean up its act, its hegemony will eventually be threatened just because it will no longer have the **moral authority** to attract the top talent to join its ranks. Perhaps that’s already the case, but it could get worse. 

**Hitherto Whereto**

As we look forward to the future, it is also good to reflect on the past and I went to dig up what I wrote for the past 2 GEs: here, here and here. The conclusion is that not a lot has changed, unfortunately. :’( 

A friend who is a long-term PAP supporter pinged me and asked me: “how ah? At this rate, we’re going to have a change of Government in 2 GEs!”

While I am not convinced that the Opposition is ready to form a Government and I suspect the Opposition will still not have the people it needs to form a competent Government in 2 GE’s, I don’t think that it’s like a given downward trend as long as the PAP just **focusses on governing the country and avoids making unnecessary Constitutional amendments**. On POFMA, I would like to be charity and give the Government some slack. There is a real problem. Unfortunately, the solution wasn’t good. 

What is clear from my past notes also is that there are longstanding grievances that the PAP has not addressed. Some policies might have been made to address certain issues, but those policies have not be communicated and explained adequately to the electorate. The PAP needs to take a leaf from Jacinda Ardern. She’s like the best thing since sliced bread as far as politics goes for the Western world. However, I don’t believe that she’s an LKY by a long shot. She just has really good showmanship. 

Singaporeans are a pragmatic lot. In fact, I think this latest showing will help the PAP in the next GE, as the prospect of a “freak” election becomes more real. Nobody really thought this round that it was plausible for the PAP not to form the Government.  There will be some amount of push back. The Opposition is also likely to get complacent and the PAP will be forced to work harder. My assessment is that the long term steady equilibrium for this country will still be a PAP Government with a minority Opposition (and I think that the Opposition will likely continue to gain a bit more ground over the next few GE’s since they do have \~40% support). 

PAP supporters please do not think that this GE is some kind of a disaster for the PAP, or for the country. 

It is not. 

But the PAP better go and find time to repent when it finds a break during our fight against COVID over the next couple of years.

On this note, I hope that we can all put this GE behind us and unite to overcome the present crisis.

My fellow Singaporean, please take COVID19 seriously. Not just the healthcare risks, but really have to brace ourselves for the nasty economic fallout. Seriously, not play play one--and be fair to the PAP. This one is really act of God and not the PAP’s fault. After we survive this massive economic tsunami, we can start squabbling again. 

Majulah Singapura.

hx9dth,1595622441,hx9dth,10,,"As a swing voter (or a moderate I guess), I voted for the WP and it has overall been an interesting election. Aside from some of the fiasco that happened between different parties, I was pretty impressed by how engaged people were in this election, compared to previous GEs. I was overseas in 2015 and apparently there were strong political sentiment during that time (especially online), but even at that time it seemed that people were just feeling very strongly about their opinions and PAP bashing just happened to be more popular than before (or at least, has become more vocal.)

Whereas in this GE, I noticed more active discussions regarding politics and the campaigns from all the parties have become more diversified like how social media has been utilized more. One can argue that this is due to covid-19 deterring public rallies from taking place, but even then I feel it wouldn't be hard to ignore these campaigns considering how vast the internet is (especially with the younger generation who would be expected to be less interested in politics than people older than them.) But I was honestly pleasantly surprised. No matter if I agree or disagree with a persons' opinions, I do think this is a sign of our society maturing, being more forward thinking and involved in how we want our country to be run, which I'm quite proud of. It also disproves perceptions of us being victims of self-censorship (which I'm not denying has been a thing in the past, it just seems less so now seeing how commonplace politics have been in conversations even within the younger generation.)

However, as someone who has voted for an opposition party, I have to say I'm perplexed by how toxic opposition supporters can be. Not saying PAP supporters are any better, but I find it ironic that all the criticisms targeted towards the PAP (like turning their politicians into cringey social media trends, inflexibility towards other perspectives and views, bashing other parties just for the sake of it, etc) are also being enacted by opposition supporters (the whole oppa Jamus thing and people calling Chee Soon Juan and Tan Cheng Bock ""hypebeasts"" being such examples.) I find opposition supporters to just shut down any opinions that talk positively of the PAP and bash them for doing so. Some even just support opposition because they don't like the PAP without giving much thought about the actual policies of the particular party they are voting for, which is just really polarising and not much better than some PAP voters who vote for them just because they assume all opposition parties are not as good as the PAP.

I think this polarisation comes from this view of parties being framed as ""PAP vs Opposition parties"", which I don't think is a healthy way to approach politics. As these parties do fundamentally defer from one other (to certain degrees) and coating over a group of parties under the same brush could lead to some thinking that if I support one opposition party meaning that would support the other opposition parties as well. Which isn't always the case.

Personally, I don't hate the PAP and I don't want them to barred from parliament (the same way I don't want the same for any party.) In fact, I still think they are overall pretty component than not just to surrounding countries, but even compared to other developed countries (this is coming from a person who has had spent quite a lot of time living overseas.) I just think they should be a credible alternative voice in parliament and I feel that the WP have pretty well planned out proposals for policies that I can see being implemented in sg, whereas the PAP is more concentrated on maintaining status quo and the vision the other parties like the SDP and the PSP have seem too idealistic to me. I supported the WP because I believed them to be the party that represent my views the best, not because I despise the PAP. Plus, having a one party parliament wouldn't be at all good for the country in the future, no matter how component they are.

hxbdl8,1595629569,hxbdl8,10,,"Hey guys! I am enlisting soon and I am currently in a dilemma on which path to take. For context: I have graduated with a diploma with 3.8. My portfolio is kinda meh with a few competition certificates and hackathon finalists. I need some advice on my future path. 

**Option 1:**

I am currently contemplating between the cyberNSF scheme which I enroll as a Full time NSF with regular pay and a 'semi' scholarship at SIT Information Security until the end of my contract I.E first 2 years of uni is fully sponsored. This is tied together with a 2 year Work and learn program: 2 Years Job experience while taking a part time degree in Info Security at SIT for 2 years. Once the 4 year contract is over, I will finish my remaining 2 years in Uni as a full time student. The 4 year contract is inclusive of the mandatory 2 years so by year 6, I will get my degree, the same time it would take with **option 2**. So at the end of the day, I don't waste any additional time in the army. The cons for this option is that I won't be able to travel and do the stuff I like having close to no freedom at all ,I'm still counted as an NSmen afterall. I should add I am not just doing this for the perks, I have an interest in cyber security as well and how its constantly evolving.

**Option 2:**

My second option is that I don't take the program and just finish my NS duties wherever I get posted to. Once I ORD, I'll probably take a degree at NUS/NT related to computing/IT(if my gpa and portfolio allows). The thing about this option is that although its simple, I get to experience the full 'Uni life'(hopefully covid is gone by then). The cons for this option is that I don't get work experience and I don't get regular pay for 4 years(2.2k+ I believe?). 

&amp;#x200B;

My initial plan was to go on as many student exchanges as I can to countries like Korea and Japan. I don't this this will be possible with Option 1 and for the exchange programmes, they send you there with like-minded people. My friends have no interest in those countries whatsoever so it'll be really difficult to plan a trip with them.

I am not young already, I took the longest route to get to where I am today; Sec5 &gt; Ite&gt; Poly. I know that money and work experience is really important now and I should do whatever I can to get into the workforce with as much preparation and experience as possible. But is it worth me sacrificing my uni life for the dull 8-5 job for the rest of my life?

If you were in my shoes, which option would you pick?

Tldr: Suck between 2 choice; Take the mature and 'more opportune' route or the route that lets me enjoy my final days by having the opportunity to study abroad/travel etc. before I enter the workforce?",,Advice needed on my future career path,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hxbdl8/advice_needed_on_my_future_career_path/

jvt8ae,1605620805,jvt8ae,10,,"
After another experience with 1627, I wanted to take the time to reflect about the mysterious people behind 1627, something I give little thought to most of the time, given that I am boliao as hell at the moment. For those that don’t know what on earth is 1627, it is the M1 customer service hotline, or the number we M1 customers call frustratingly all the time. 

Every M1 user probably has experienced the experience of dialling 1627. Whether you’ve pressed 1, or 2, or some other number before pressing 0, all of us here can understand what it feels like to dial 1627, from the endless ‘There’s an easy way to find you if you’re eligible to recontract ’ or being told 10+ times how to check your bills, we’ve all been there, waiting, listening to the endless automated voice while we are on hold, before finally connecting to a CS agent.

I too can share these experiences, whether it be my broadband breaking down, or my mobile data not working all of a sudden, picking up a phone, dialling 1627, navigating the confusing auto attendant by pressing random numbers, listening to a never ending loop of a recording telling us about Mindy, which you can get a hold of by going to the m1 website or the app, The M1 App, How to check your bills, How to check for your recontracting eligibility, before finally connecting with a CS agent. Ask any M1 user, and they probably have the same automated speech etched into their head after numerous times of dialing 1627, before connecting to a CS agent. (TBH, M1 should give loyalty discounts for anyone that can recite word for word what the automated voice says while you’re on hold at one go)

However, in our frustration, many of us forget that the CS agents, are just human, after all, who wouldn’t be frustrated after M1 straight up fucks up, causing us to lose precious productive minutes, in a fast paced Singapore, or your YouTube/Netflix stopping in the middle of a cliffhanger moment. From being shouted at, cursed at, for issues out of their control by angry sinkies. Especially disruptions which is probably their worst nightmare, being an CS agent, especially at M1 and Singapore, definitely isn’t chicken feet, from what I can infer.

At the moment, given that home based broadband usage is at record levels, even though the peak of CB is over. I would like to take the time to thank our under appreciated m1 CS agents, for helping us to fix M1’s fuckups, our fuckup, or any random queries we have, especially during this M1 disruption. Thank you, M1 CS agents, for being patient with us, especially during the unique circumstances of this year. thank you for your efforts, to try and help us with our problems with M1. Thank you, for answering my queries at 3am, after my broadband mysteriously dies. Thank you, for doing your best to fix my broadband/mobile problems.

With M1’s reliability, I cannot imagine a life with M1 without the mysterious people behind 1627. Thank you once again, mysterious people answering 1627, for helping to make M1 bearable at least, while we wait out a 2 year contract only to renew coz all the other providers are either too expensive or shit, at least we still get a CS agent to speak to, whom as far as I’m aware, still isn’t outsourced to other countries. (looking at you, SingPost)

In conclusion, let us be kinder to our M1 customer service host, for all they are doing, is trying to help us get over M1/our fuckups that are out of their control. Next time we dial 1627, maybe say thank you to the people behind 1627, and be kind to them, it’s already tiring being a CS agent in Singapore already, so let us not add to their already tired workday, after all, they are still humans.",,Appreciation for those answering our calls to 1627,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jvt8ae/appreciation_for_those_answering_our_calls_to_1627/

A couple friends and I from the US booked a Singapore/Thailand trip from March 20 - April 4th. This was before the virus outbreak of course, so we've been following closely on the news and have been considering cancelling.

Anyway, my friends and I are still not super concerned with the virus situation but our families are super worried. I just wanted an idea from locals on how different Singapore is nowadays and if it's worth it to travel there now. As in, are all tourist attractions open? Does life seem to be going on as normal? Of course we'll exercise precautions as we're there but we aren't super concerned with contracting the virus as the Singapore govt seems to be doing a great job of tracking every case and quarantining as necessary.

We were talking about COVID and how there might be a Tekong cluster, and we both agreed that NSFs are essential services and should still be processed. But he brought up the issue about how underpaid they are. (We are both late 20's by the way)

I asked him — how do you propose we find the funds to pay them? This was when his boner stuck up.

He told me about this idea of a ""woman's tax"". For two years, female wages will be ""garnished"" and the money will be put into a centralised pot. The pot will then be used to bump up NSF's wages to a somewhat respectable amount in the ballpark of $1000, which isn't unreasonable if a women contributes around $300 a month, or less if the garnishing period is over three years instead.

This period, he told me, should ""probably start when they get their first full time job but that seems too easy to rig so IDK"". He added that maybe a fixed amount of contributions might make things easier.

He went on to discuss the numbers and how different income levels will contribute different sums, but it's quite boring and I don't remember the specific digits so I won't go into detail.

But he continued, after a prompt, to tell me that the ""pot"" idea was significant as it could help with population fluctuations, which mean that if there were less men that year, there'll be leftover money in the pot for when there were more men.

When there is too much money in the pot, we can have a ""GST Voucher"" for men.

As a joke, I told him, ""But women serve NS through childbirth"". This was when he went galactic brain on me.

""If a woman is pregnant, it means she is married right? The extra money her husband gets will be hers anyway so it's all fair.""

This honestly sounds so retarded but the way he put it across was so convincing I was curious to see if any of you have any criticisms I can pass along to him.

In light of the recent developments of the virus situation and the implementation of measures which has resulted in the closure of exercise places like stadiums, gyms, fitness studious, I am sure it has become harder to maintain an active lifestyle when most of us are home for extended periods of time due to the partial lockdown.

As most of our homes are limited in spaces, we can then look towards exercises which require little to no equipment nor space but is still effective in maintaining our fitness and health in this trying times.

Therefore, I would like to make a small contribution by sharing some exercises which have worked for me and I which I have been doing to maintain my health and fitness.


Bodyweight - Resistance Training

Upperbody:

1. Pushups - Normal Width

2. Pushups - Narrow


Lowerbody:

1. Squats 

2. Lunges

3. Calve Raises

4. Glute Bridge


Core:

1. Plank

2. Side Plank

3. Knee To Elbow Plank

4. Hollow Hold

5. Sit Ups

6. Crunches

7. Reverse Crunch

8. Bicycle Crunch

9. Side Crunches

10. Knee Tugs

11. Leg Raises

12. Flutter Kicks

13. Scissors Kicks

14. Russian Twist

15. Hip Dips


HIIT - Cardiovascular Training

1. Skipping - If you don't have a skipping rope just replicate the motion

2. High Knee

3. Cross Knee

4. Side Knee

5. Butt Kicks

6. Burpee

7. Mountain Climbers

8. Jumping Jacks


Tips:

1. Consistency is the key.

2. It isn't about the amount you can do, focus more on proper form.

3. Just show up everyday and you will see a lot of improvement.

4. Experiment on different variations if exercises are too easy or too difficult.

5. Don't try to do all the exercises at one time start with 1-3 exercises and let your body get conditioned to it.


All of these exercises can be found online so knowing their proper forms would be easy to check. I tend to suffer from information overload, so I am hoping consolidating all the information in one post would help those whom want to exercise in their homes.

Stay safe folks and god speed and I hope this helps in some way.

gz5zdu,1591644327,gz5zdu,11,,"&gt; From a Singaporean Chinese living in Singapore：
&gt; 
&gt; I questioned the white police’s abuse of blacks, but my American colleague made me think.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, my white American colleague David and I participated in a video conference about the export project. He was late for 30 minutes. After the line connected, he joined the meeting. He explained that it was late because the demonstrations by the people caused traffic jams.
&gt;  
&gt; After the meeting, I specifically asked him not to go offline, so as to chat with him about the unrest in the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; I asked him: Is the United States safe now?  He told me it was safe, I smiled and sent him a few pictures:
&gt; 
&gt; Demonstrators burned the American flag, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; While he was looking at the photos, I asked ridiculously: Is this America safe?  If yes, please do tell me what is unsafe?
&gt;  
&gt; David understood what I meant. He smiled embarrassedly, shrugged, and said: This kind of thing is very common in the United States, but this time someone recorded a video, plus the police did a bit too much. So a large-scale black riot occurred.
&gt;  
&gt; He said it casually, as if nothing unusual had happened.  
&gt; 
&gt; I asked him: Don’t you worry that black people might one day take up arms and retaliate against white people?
&gt;  
&gt; After listening to my words, David gave a hearty laugh. He gave me a grave look. He said to me:
&gt;  
&gt; James (my English name), black people are absolutely afraid to use guns against white people. They are not stupid. What kind of consequences will result from doing so? 
&gt; 
&gt; Black people are very clear about this point.
&gt;  
&gt; Since the establishment of the United States, black people have served white people, and this is what it means for them to live.  In the United States, as long as a white man is killed by a black man, the black man will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. However, if a white man kills a black man, the probability that the white man will be guilty of murder or manslaughter is very low. The most serious being a fine or a short sentence.
&gt; 
&gt; After hearing what he said, I felt very indignant. I told him: The United States is a country with serious racial discrimination. Apart from white people, any colored people living in the United States have no human rights and are denied.
&gt; 
&gt; David was puzzled and asked me why I was angry.
&gt;  
&gt; I said: I feel sad and indignant for the black man who died tragically under the knee of a white American policeman.
&gt; 
&gt; David listened to me and asked me in a serious tone: Are you really sad about the death of black people?
&gt; 
&gt; I said: Of course, should an innocent person be abused and killed by white policemen, shouldn't he be sympathized?  
&gt; David listened to me, sighed, and then asked me:
&gt;  
&gt; Do you know who has the lowest status in the United States?  
&gt; 
&gt; “Black"", I blurted out.
&gt; 
&gt; He smiled contemptuously and told me point blank: it is the Chinese!
&gt; 
&gt;  Looking at my startled expression, David continued:
&gt;  
&gt; The status of black people in the United States is higher than that of Chinese people, and black people are particularly willing to attack yellow people, especially Chinese students and other Chinese.
&gt;  
&gt; The situation is this: white people despise everyone, and black people despise the Chinese: this is the contempt chain.
&gt;  
&gt; David asked me whether I knew that during this riot, many Chinese shops and Chinese students have become the targets of black attacks?
&gt; 
&gt; I had serious doubts about his remark, because the riot has nothing to do with Chinese or Chinese students.
&gt;  
&gt; He sent me some photos of the riot scene:
&gt; 
&gt; Chinese restaurants and grocery shops lit by demonstrators.
&gt;  
&gt; Even a Chinese student who was a takeaway deliveryman became the target of the demonstrators' attack. His head was seriously injured, his head was dripping with blood, his eyes were smashed, and his life was in serious danger.
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing my glum silence, David went on to say: Black people are the most willing to attack Chinese or Chinese students. When they are angry, unhappy, and need to vent, Chinese often become the target of their attack.  During the previous epidemic, many Chinese and Chinese students were attacked by black people:
&gt; 
&gt; Because the Chinese were wearing masks, a black man hit him with more than 40 punches in the head!
&gt; 
&gt; A black man poured sulfuric acid into the head of a Chinese woman who came out and dumped garbage, causing her terrible burns!
&gt; 
&gt; David told me: James, you are sad for the death of the black people, and you are humbling for them. I really have a hard time understanding.  When black people face white people, they are very pitiful and cowardly, but when they face Chinese or Chinese students, they are different.
&gt;  
&gt; They will never let go of any opportunity to insult or beat your compatriots. Can you understand what I mean?

&gt;If you look at Singapore, everyone pays some taxes, mainly GST, some people if they have a car they pay COE and some car taxes, and if you are better off you pay some income tax. Everyone pays some taxes, everyone takes some benefits.  
&gt;  
&gt;How much does the middle income group get in benefits -- one form of subsidy or another -- compared to the taxes paid? **For every one dollar paid in taxes by the middle income group, a family will get back two dollars** in subsidies: education, healthcare, subsidies in retirement. Every one dollar paid you get back two dollars, and this is especially after this year's budget, where we strengthened our benefits for the middle income group.  
&gt;  
&gt;How does it compare with these countries which appear to have very fair systems? Free healthcare, free many things, or close-to-free many things. How does it compare? Scandinavian countries: if you look at Finland, for every one dollar paid in taxes by the middle income group they get back one dollar thirty cents. Only thirty cents more than the taxes they pay. In our case it's two dollars back in benefits for the one dollar they pay. United Kingdom: for every one dollar of taxes paid, they get one dollar forty cents back. Slightly more than Scandinavia. Same thing for the United States.  
&gt;  
&gt;How much do the poor get? **If you look at the bottom ten percent of Singaporeans, for every one dollar of taxes they pay, which is mainly GST, they get back six dollars in subsidies**. These are facts. Six dollars. How about the rich in Singapore? **Those in the top ten percent? For every one dollar they pay, they get back twenty cents**. That's what I call a fair system.

What is really going on: they're not counting the free money disproportionately given to rich families through scholarships (snapped up by kids getting expensive private tuition), or policies that favour capital-owners over workers.

Nor are they factoring Singapore's much higher income inequality.

Poor people get back 6 dollars in subsidies per dollar taxed, because their income is pathetic to begin with. Their spending is so low, that there is nothing much to tax.

If their income were higher, they would be spending more, and the subsidy/tax ratio would be lower. E.g. if they had the ability to spend twice as much on goods and services, the figure would instantly drop to 3 dollars subsidies per dollar taxed.

PAP is so good at creatively interpreting statistics to fit their preferred narrative.

But they are not being entirely honest. To me, it is disingenuous and misleading.

\---

Also, our lowest-in-the-world Covid-19 case fatality rate is the result of having young, relatively healthy migrant workers infected en masse due to PAP's apathy and negligence. Yet they manage to spin it into a positive, and continue to use it to pat themselves on the back.

 The  Dictator Game typically consists of two individuals, one of whom is given some quantity of money. The second individual is given nothing. The participant given the money, known in the experiment as “the dictator,” is told that he must offer some amount of that money to the second participant, even if that amount is zero. Whatever amount the dictator offers to the second participant must be accepted. The second participant, should he find the amount unsatisfactory, cannot then punish the dictator in any way 

[Ultimatum Game](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Ultimatum_Game#Description)

Created by the Israeli game theorist Ariel Rubinstein, the ultimatum game, like the dictator game, usually involves two people. In the ultimatum game, after the first player is given some quantity of money, said first player must make an offer to the second player of how much of the money he is willing to share. If the offer of the first player is rejected by the second player, neither player gets to keep any money.

When I was a kid, by which I mean from when I was a toddler to about when I was in kindergarten, she used to sing a song to me. I remember just three lines of it:

""The lion is the king,  
The king of all the animals.  
The lion is the king,  
...""

I have absolutely no idea where this song comes from, or if it comes from anywhere at all. Maybe she made it up herself! Does anybody else recognise these lyrics? Did anyone else's grandmother sing this to them too?

To give a bit of background, I'm in my early 30s. My grandmother is in her early 80s. The period she sang this tune would have been around the early 1990s. My grandmother is English-speaking. She's one of those very Ang Moh peranakans who, a few years ago during Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, could recall the lyrics to God Save the Queen. So it might have come from a British or other Commonwealth source.

I tried googling the lyrics, but they're generic enough that I don't get anything helpful, and putting the lines between quotation marks just gets me a lot of sites that say ""the lion is the king of all the animals"", rather than the two sentences separate.

This is really trivial and sentimental, but if anybody happens to recall anything, it might help a bit to settle an uneasy heart.",,My grandmother used to sing me this song many years ago when I was a little kid.

glz7lt,1589798861,glz7lt,12,,"I first posted this elsewhere but despite receiving warm and validating comments, I'm still feeling extremely low, suicidal, and triggered. So I've decided to post here because I'm hoping that a local perspective might help. I wonder if anyone has ever had such experiences from the very people who're supposed to understand and help them.  

My story is simple. I haven't worked in about 4 years. This hasn't been due to laziness, but due to issues that I haven't been able to overcome. 

My confidence regarding working and functioning are a result of a father who was overly-critical and perfectionistic. He works at the SAF and brought that same sort of mentality home. He would shout, berate and shame me if things weren't done his way. Everything had to be done perfectly. His words would drip with condescension when he spoke to me. Even something as simple as washing the dishes could get him riled up. 

As a result, I developed a huge fear of failure and a fear of making mistakes. I believe that I'm stupid, unworthy and just not good enough. I have no faith in my abilities, even simple abilities like being able to understand concepts is problematic for me. These seem like basic fears that most people struggle with to some degree, but unfortunately for me, they have become debilitating and have affected every part of my life. 

I survived in school as far as grades were concerned, but only because I could go home and study on my own. I had a difficult time with anything that required me to use my hands, like science experiments, or my brain, like being tested on the spot. I still remember how we had to do practicals every Thursdays in JC. I would lie in bed awake the night before, unable to sleep, sick with worry. During the experiments, I would be so nervous that my hands would be trembling throughout the lesson. 

This extended to the non-academic side of things as well. I vividly remember an instance where my teacher asked me to count some money, and I was so flustered that my heart was pounding and my hands were trembling. I did not even trust myself to count money! 

Besides the stuff with my father, I have a history of other childhood trauma which led to a lot of mental illnesses. I was severely depressed all throughout my schooling years. About 4 years ago, I dropped out of JC without completing my A levels. I couldn't do it. I was suicidal, depressed, and couldn't focus in the slightest. Since then, I haven't worked either. I'm a NEET. I have tried going back to school twice since then, but dropped out after a short period each time. I very clearly have issues and am in therapy trying to work through them. 

The reason I even started making this post was basically this: my psychiatrist saw me a couple of days ago and told me that I am depressed because I haven't worked in years. She called it a ""chicken or egg situation"". Not being able to work can lead to depression. The CB and lockdown is hard for people for so many reasons, but not being able to work, esp. if you can't WFH, is one of the reasons for some. Calling it a chicken or egg situation would have been a completely reasonable response had it come from someone who'd just met me. 

But this a doctor I've worked with for years and years. She knows that I was extremely depressed even while I was at school and busy. And all the times I went back to school after a period of inactivity, I STILL remained depressed. This is someone who should know my depression is not caused nor significantly worsened by inactivity. 

Telling me that it’s my employment is the cause of my depression invalidates all my experiences. It's almost as though she was telling me that what I went through wasn't enough to cause depression, and that the only reason I'm depressed is because I'm unemployed. So basically, I’m this dysfunctional and in this much pain, and it's all because I'm unemployed. If only I had worked, I wouldn't have been in this situation at all. 

I feel blamed. It would have been fine if she had said that unemployment \*worsens\* depression. But calling it a chicken or egg situation broke me completely. For anyone who's ever been through trauma of any sort, you would know that one of the things that go through your mind is, ""it wasn't bad enough"". We invalidate ourselves, but to be invalidated by a professional who's supposed to understand can feel devastating.

Here is the thing though, I was severely depressed even while I was in school and busy. 

At the end of the session, she added that their goal is to make me functional. I broke down the minute I left her room. 

I feel sad and broken today, and so terribly triggered. Every Chinese new year, I get the same questions and same looks when people realise I'm a NEET. I know that people view our worth based on how productive we are. But all that does is fill us with shame and make us feel even more useless, and very often, even more helpless. As someone who was raised to be ultra productive all the time, when I first dropped out school, I would starve myself because I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. I felt like I didn't even deserve to live because I was no longer a productive member of society. 

Let me emphasise this though, I do believe that staying busy is important for our mental health. I still exercise, try to meet people when I can muster the strength to, I try to eat properly, I get sunlight. I would like to work, and I would've done so if I could. Even though it doesn't help with depression in my case, it still gives me a sense of purpose for each day. I wish I could explain the helplessness I feel when trying to explain why I've been unable to work so far. I wish I could explain that I cannot just pull myself up by my bootstraps, and that the conventional advice of staying busy, exercising and eating well, while useful, doesn't work much for some of us. 

Being functional  is most definitely important, and it can be a starting goal, but it certainly can't be an end goal. Being functional doesn't equate to being mentally healthy. I WAS functional while I was in school. And for many of us, being functional doesn't make us better in any significant way, especially if our issues are deep rooted. 

It's \*not\* a chicken and egg situation in my case. Not even close. I don't think my doctor meant to hurt me. The sad reality is that quite often, even professionals don't really get it and perpetuate the same narratives that damage us.",,From the perspective of a NEET,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/glz7lt/from_the_perspective_of_a_neet/

TLDR: Political fear mongering is a tool used to garner votes. Perhaps not beneath candidates running for parliament in Singapore. 

Our future PM has stated that a clear mandate is required, he has also stated that anything other than PAP is risky.

I would like to remind everyone that the government of the day is formed by a simple majority. And with approximately 63 seats that government will have free reign over our country.

Looking at the opposition, note comments by WP (above article) and PSP ( [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/progress-singapore-party-member-draws-ire-with-remarks-on-proposed-opposition-alliance](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/progress-singapore-party-member-draws-ire-with-remarks-on-proposed-opposition-alliance) ). The opposition clearly does not have faith in their own peers to win against the PAP. What are the chances that oppositions aside from PSP and WP might win a single seat?

In any case, let's evaluate the potential contests that the PAP faces - outside of WP and PSP.

[https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-with-new-leaders-and-new-parties-a-much-changed-opposition-gets-ready-for](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-with-new-leaders-and-new-parties-a-much-changed-opposition-gets-ready-for)

We start with our honorable SPP, thank you Mr Chiam for your years of service and dedication.  What is the SPP without CST, the party has been in a downward spiral since he took a step back. A party run on a person's legacy is nothing but an empty shell.

Our resident siao lang keng (this is not a term given by me), SDP, has always put forth people with very strong credentials but they still face a huge stigma because of reasons. Regardless, at the end of the day the majority of voters vote on emotion rather than rationality. With approximately 11 seats up for grabs, let's give CSJ 3 for the lulz, after all we should be looking at the worst case scenario for HSK right?

Next up! we have the NSP. This party likes to talk about jokes, unfortunately they are the funniest of the bunch! In 2011, it was called the nicole seah party, after a candidate! How low must you go before you completely lose your party's identity? With every face of the 2015 NSP joining a new party for 2020, what is the NSP? It is nothing but a brand new party with brand new faces. Cross fingers, in the best case opposition scenario NSP doesn't go bankrupt.

PPP, who gives up before the fight begins? Declaring its your last election before nomination day and complaining about how tough it is on your family - I feel for you. Really I get it. The people probably get it too.... I applaud you for putting nation before self but when you can't even support your family, please call it quits.

DPP, I guess I spoke too soon, the DPP pulled out before anyone even asked if they were contesting.

RP, the leader of RP is serving his SHN now, his campaigning is probably going to be highly ineffective from that position.

Did I forget to mention the SDA? An alliance meant to bring together groups of opposition parties - a bold idea by our dear CST. However, since leadership has changed hands, it is but a shell. In any case, the SDA will be contesting in ppp grc. with two-thirds of PAP's teo's standing in ppp grc, I doubt they stand a chance.

PV, I don't know much about lim tean, what I know about him is he enjoys pointing fingers at the government with little concrete solutions. For a tiny party to declare a shadow minister kind of signals they are slightly unhinged.

Red dot ?? The first time I heard of these people was last night, they are contesting in Jurong GRC. I think this signals outright that they are off the rails. DO you know who runs in Jurong? Can anyone tell me ????

&amp;#x200B;

YES, the prime minister we WANT and NEED but do not DESERVE!!!!

Apparently we aren't ready for an Indian PM (shame on Singapore )

BUT WAIT, I have only mentioned 11 parties.... oh right... one party DISSOLVED!

With a total of 21 seats being contested by WP, giving TCB west coast grc and throwing in 3 SMCs for SDP (because why not) . PAP will return with a minimum of 64 seats! A beautiful 2/3's majority to pass any bill that the next government may desire.

In fact, if koh poh koon decides to abandon YCK to create a 4 way fight in punggol west, leaving YCK seat empty, The PAP will still be returned with a 2/3's majority! I highly suggest he does so, the urge to serve punggol must have been burning inside of him.",,A response to HSK,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hhoiqu/a_response_to_hsk/

hmvqse,1594132766,hmvqse,12,,"The past 5 years have been a rollercoaster. 

In 2015, LKY died. And that was the beginning of troubles for the Lee Family, not only 38 Oxley Road, but against Li Shengwu etc. 

There were MRT shutting down earlier for maintenance, delays once every in a while.

There were the bike-sharing companies, particularly Ofo, Obike and Mobike, which caused a mess by flooding the streets with bicycles, many of them spoilt but not maintained. In the end, a lot of users lost their deposits, including me.

After that, PMDs were basically a repeat of what happened with bike-sharing. Under-regulation for a while, then as complaints increased over time, regulations got tougher. But instead of co-existing like bicycles managed to, basically PMDs were mostly gone after the most recent regulations to be off walkways.

In terms of jobs, the situation seems to be getting worse even without COVID-19. The trend of contract jobs, which reeks of job insecurity, gave many people nightmares. Even permanent jobs were insecure, as I have personally seen large amounts living a company within a few months (once, it was over 50%, from low to high positions).

For housing-wise, I have heard a few close contacts and read online that BTOs are hard to bid for, so some couples choose to go for resale, or private housing. But hey, maybe the areas they bid for are of higher popularity.

To be honest, the situation on the ground has been unstable, maybe only me, that I only really have the energy to really read up on the policies over the past 5 years, like the POFMA, and the reserved presidency with a walkover (since I was not affected by it). But the more I read, the more I'm scared. 

I'm really scared of what the next 5 years will be, especially after the past few months of the handling of COVID-19. I remember that everyone was confused, and for a period of time, every few days there would be an amendment. No one knew what is illegal anymore, anyone I asked, they are not sure. Plus if you did something wrong, there would be no warning, first offenders would be fined. There was a climate of fear, and more so even now. No one knows when they might contract COVID-19, or forget to wear a mask or come within 1m and be fined. Or at least for me. I really wish all the best for business owners, hang in there!

But on the bright side, we have cheap private-hailing rides for a few years, remember when Grab was free after vouchers? And food delivery services made food and drinks cheap and easy to order. Lift upgrading, partial home renovation by HDB and other infrastructure upgrades also made things more convenient.

Various attractions and parks were opened or improved upon, like the Coast-to-Coast Trail, Coney Island (remember the hype?), a lot of new shopping malls and neighbourhood shopping areas, hawker centres etc. etc. Lots of places to makan especially hahaha.

I think at the end of the period since the last GE, all I hope and wish is that whoever becomes the incumbents, please just try your best for the interests of Singapore. And for all the stakeholders, politics does not have to be polarising, we can agree to disagree, what's most important is our happiness. Live and let live.

Here's the story:

Basically my father was the ""victim"" of this pandemic. In addition to this, he recently had a relapse in his cancer condition which cause his immune system to weaken with the addition of chemotherapy and all.
My father was in close contact with his friend (COVID-19 positive) as they met up to exercise together in an open area (i shall not state where) on Saturday (08/08). The thing is his friend fetched his wife who was feeling unwell in the afternoon and she was tested positive. So, he had asked the doctor to send him for testing and turned out positive. However, my dad was only informed by the health officials he was a close contact after 2 whole days (basically Monday) and told him to effectively start quarantining and stay at home until officials come in person to decide whether they need to move him to a facility (which could arrive ""anytime""). What was worse, the officials who called my dad do not have a definite answer on how to handle cancer relapse patients like him if he were to be sent to a quarantine facility (we have a maid here to take care of the daily basic necessities at home). To add on to my frustration, they called today and told my dad that they will not send officials over and probably will not do swabbing. In addition to that, they told us that only my dad needs quarantine. The rest of us immediate household members can do whatever we want and go out whenever we want. They will only do a video call with my dad later in the day to check on him.

There are many things that ticks me off:

Why does his friend did not tell my father about his/his wife's positive testing?

Why the officials took 2 whole days to finally trace back to my dad as his close contact?

Why can't the officials just conduct swabbing now and at the end of 14 days of SHN?

Why are the officials slacking on the pandemic by not physically sending people over to see if my dad can be quarantined at home effectively?

Why does testing have to only be done on people who display symptoms? There are asymptomatic cases out there too.

Will the officials take full responsibility for being incompetent in informing us and not upholding the measures to ensure our health and well-being?

Are these many of the few things that many other countries see us as the ""gold standard"" for?

Strange...4 family members and only 1 wearing a mask. When my music stopped, I heard coughing. Turns out, she was having the flu and was coughing non stop on the bus. Then, I saw that her mask was only covering her mouth. The top part of the mask was on her upper lip, leaving the nose fully exposed. Okay you sick still take public transport.

Furthermore, we’re seeing boomers hoarding MRT and bus seats and kicking out the people who work hard to help the people suffering from the virus, acting like little brats. 

So how can we stop this? 

1). Speak out. Find ways to communicate with fellow Singaporeans, maybe condo/hdb management, and get them to raise awareness (maybe putting posters in lifts to quell the panic).

2). Do an epic Reddit Moment and use copypastas, going back to the early 2000’s in the form of helpful chain messages. I’ve attempted this in several groups and it’s reached quite a few people. Perhaps we could also promote signing up to the gov.sg Whatsapp Updates so we get more people to understand the actual nature of the threat.

&gt;Dr Asok Kurup, an infectious disease physician at Mount Elizabeth  Hospital revealed to SCMP that on a daily basis, there are about 15 to  20 people, mostly Indonesians, who want to be tested for the  coronavirus. But they were turned away because they did not meet the  criteria to be tested. Even if these Indonesians insist and want to pay a  lot more for a Covid-19 test, Singapore doctors will not be able to do  so as the test kits are government-subsidized and controlled.  
&gt;  
&gt;Singapore  currently only tests those who have been to areas with surging  infection rates or those with severe respiratory infections. Indonesia  at the moment is not seen as an area with surging infection rates.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another  doctor, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, told SCMP that he has been getting about 5  calls a day from foreigners, mostly from Indonesia and Cambodia, asking  to be tested for Covid-19. “Everyone has so much fear, and fear can  \[cause panic, leading us to\] use our tests \[on healthy people\],” he  said.

Sources of Data for Covid Patients in [Singapore from the Singapore Government](https://www.gov.sg/article/covid-19-cases-in-singapore#week-6:-24-feb---1-mar), and [China from Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/).

Now, let's begin.

I  think that people are (rightly so) worried at how much the Covid cases are increasing. Yes, the cases are rising exponentially,  and yes, this is just the beginning. Things are about to get much worse.

However, there is something interesting. You see, I read a [Post from /r/DataIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fn6czo/oc_maybe_an_interesting_different_way_of_looking/)  which showed the progression of Covid cases in different countries in a  different way. The original poster wanted to measure the ""acceleration""  of the Covid cases. If the ""acceleration"" decreased, it means that  whatever measures the country is taking to slow down the cases may be  working.

I've adapted the model  used by that poster into a simpler model. The increase in Covid cases in  each country can be thought of as an exponential curve, where **y = e \^ (c.x)**, where x is the number of days that have passed, and c is the ""constant"" of acceleration.

Therefore, to obtain the value of c for every day, we would need to calculate the natural logarithm:

ln y = c.x ln e ; which gives us **ln y = c.x**

Finally, we divide both sides by x in order to obtain the constant, **(ln y)/x = c**

What I've done then is plot this constant value against the number of days for each country. Let us begin first with **China**:

# [China's Data](https://i.imgur.com/rSt83so.png)

As you can see, for the first 21 days, China's cases were *somewhat* linear. But the interesting thing is that **the constant was decreasing day-by-day.**

This  is especially true when you look at the big picture and plot out the  data for 56 days. The curve for the number of cases ceases to be linear  and now there is a plateau. **The constant keeps decreasing everyday**. The goal is to get the constant as close to 0 as possible to reduce the amount of cases per day.

Therefore, it seems that the measures taken by the Chinese Government have been somewhat effective.

For the 56th day, China's constant was **0.201**

# [Singapore's Data](https://i.imgur.com/UYI0ghY.png)

The data in Singapore is... interesting. For the first 21 days, the increase was *somewhat* linear as well. However, the constant is erratic**.** It **can be argued that the constant for the first 21 days is** ***somewhat*** **linear** as well. Meaning that the Singapore government's **measures were somewhat successful in keeping the constant to 1 (on average).**

However, the full picture comes for 56 days. **It seems that the Singapore Government's measures for the last 14 days managed to reduce the constant**. If the authorities keep it up, they might be able to control the number of cases.

For the 56th Day, Singapore's constant was **0.269**

Again, I do not claim that this data is an accurate model of anything. It was just me messing around in Excel.",,A different way of Looking at Covid Data: Comparing SG and China,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fne61j/a_different_way_of_looking_at_covid_data/

I was doing something very similar for a couple of years in Australia before I got stood down indefinitely due to social distancing guidelines.

I also find many, but not all Australians difficult to work with. Oftentimes, they are lazy, slow-thinking, disorganised and have a hard time thinking outside the box. It would be nice to work with a more disciplined and productive workforce, if Singapore offers that.

I understand that an Australian law degree would be acceptable in Singapore since it’s a common law country, though I don’t want to practise law and was looking at using my law degree to get into other social sciences work. Once I return to work in Australia, I am thinking of saving money to leave the country for after I graduate from university.

However, this is where things went horribly wrong. I probably chose the wrong hypermarket provider to issue my delivery. Here is what went wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I thought maybe the delivery of groceries and packages would be like how your orders from Shopee or Lazada come. That the items are reserved before being delivered, however this is not the case for orders which stem from Giant. It is packed the day before you order the item. So for example with something that is scarce in todays hypermarkets- lets say err Tapioca Starch with all the bubble tea shops which have closed yesterday, you place the order on the item(immediately)(coz super high demand) and the delivery date is stipulated to be next week Monday, the way their logistics work is that instead of reserving the items from their warehouse, they would get people to collect the items(FairPrice uses a hybrid of this system and packs before time) the day before you place the order. from their physical stores. This then goes to their delivery fleet and then gets sent to your home. This means that if the item is not available N+4 days after you placed a valid order(along w the delivery fee) you would be informed the very evening before the delivery the next day that items X/Y/Z are now unavailable. And the best part of this experience is their customer support. After inquiring with them(the customer support team) with regards to this issue, my dude just told me that just shop at places other than Giant if I want quality service and deliveries on time.

&amp;#x200B;

/rant

Sorry for the rant but I think that people should know where they are getting their groceries from in the event that the Supermarkets are very crowded. 

Note: Im not blaming our essential workers but the logistics' management and the customer service agents(who probably recived multiple calls like mine)(and made them even more sian/annoyed) because of the rudeness that one person emanated in the phone call. And do not be surprised if many of your items just disappear off your delivery notice haha when you're expecting a shipment from them haha.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:I guess in this current situation - please try not to use the delivery system provided by Giant because it has a very big logical flaw in the mechanism that they deliver goods to the end user, use alternative grocery partners such as FairPrice or Sheng Siong instead",,A small rant about online grocery delivery service from (Giant),https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g60naf/a_small_rant_about_online_grocery_delivery/

She works from home but still goes out to buy groceries once in awhile, and both the other tenant and I are in essential business so we go out and return everyday.

edit: Yes, it is nothing overly aggressive from her, but firstly, whenever I'm in my room, my door is closed. So there is no way I can tell if she is in the living/dining room.

A bit of background, I (M,17) and my 2 half-siblings live with my mother. My mother has severe anxiety and depression, and she leaves the house for long periods at a time to disappear. As such, I have to end up taking care of my siblings, who are 4 years old and 10 years old respectively. This means cooking for them, making them clean up after themselves, entertaining them and taking them out etc, which is worrying now because I'm secondary 4 and if I leave my siblings at home during their HBL, I'm super scared on how they'll be treated.

Why I'm scared? My mother can't cook, let alone even help my siblings with their homework. In the events that she does teach them, the police are sometimes called because of how badly she reacts when my little brother (10y/o) doesn't listen to her. An example of her reaction is she threatened suicide against my brother because he didn't finish his Chinese homework in time.

Another example would be me cooking a meal for everyone, and she would immediately spray it with Lysol or cleaning solution because she's paranoid that she could get covid. This has happened multiple times under my supervision, and whenever I head to school now I end up packing lunch for my siblings. 

I don't know if it's abuse. I've talked to my friends about this and they said that because she's depressed she's acting like this, which I can really understand, but I feel I hit my limit. Whenever she has a breakdown, I'm the one she has to comfort, not me, the child.

I've tried asking my neighbours for babysitting help, but because of my mother's frequent outbursts, they don't really trust me, and I'm really at my wit's end because my relatives as well don't want to do anything with my mother. 

So, how do I get help for my mother? Is there any alternative I can get for my siblings?",,[Rant] What's the fine line between mental illness and abuse?,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/he360b/rant_whats_the_fine_line_between_mental_illness/

One very important thing that people focus on (for some reasons, not so in their country) is the business of dirty politics. The form of cheating, going against morality, mindset, common sense. These are dirty stuff that will RUIN OUR LIVES even though they are often sugar coating them. One such example is the fact of telling lies to promises and then backtracked on the promise. Another is just simply playing around the rules while acting apologetic to it.  


As we head towards our election, let us not forget what was done throughout these times, evaluate carefully what was done out of good or bad faith, and the re-evaluate the candidates whether are they honest to begin with or not. (That applies to both parties) In that way, we will not suffer what we expected to suffer when our choices are drowned by the system, the system of votes, news coverage, social influences, personal views and biasness, deception, to which we would come to a more informed and well considered conclusion to cast our vote.

hmm415,1594089462,hmm415,13,,"On 6 July 2020, there were 2 statements made by the incumbent which were high profile, reported in the media, and which may have contained false information. But there does not seem to have been any contemplation of the use of POFMA, which underscores the systemic unfairness of the law - it is a sword in the hands of one side only. 

This is not a partisan exercise - but rather, to underscore the dangers of the law as currently structured. 

Let's walk through these statement and see if this reasoning holds. 

**Were opposition parties ""completely silent"" on COVID-19 recovery?** 

During the Fullerton Rally, this is what LHL said: 

&gt;""\[The Opposition\] has been completely silent on how to tackle COVID-19, both during the last 6 months, and during this election campaign.""

So let's take a look at the requirements for the issuance of a correction direction under POFMA.The requirements of the issuance of a correction direction are as follows: (a) a false statement of fact has been or is being communicated in Singapore; and (b) the Minister (or in the case of the election period, the Alternate Authority i.e. the appointed Perm Secs) is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to issue a direction. Public interest is defined to include if the statement is likely to ""influence... a general election of Members of Parliament...""

Was LHL's statement untrue? I think so. I'm not going to go through what each party said, but here's 2 examples from the larger parties: 

1. Chapter 1 of the WP manifesto is entitled ""Tackling COVID-19 and Thriving in a Post-COVID World"". There are about 5 pages devoted to the plans for tackling the pandemic itself, and another 3 and a half with proposals on how to emerge from the crisis. 
2. The PSP's manifesto was not framed in the same way and was less comprehensive, but rather under each 2 sections (economy and social development) had proposals on how to address specific issues wrought by the pandemic.   

Was it in the public interest to issue the statement? Again, I'm going to say yes - the context of the statement was in a Rally speech, so the statement was clearly intended to influence how voters voted in this election. 

So the criteria in this case - in my view - have been met. Of course, the question is whether the relevant Perm Sec is of the opinion that this is in the public interest to issue - which I guess they are not. This is compounded by the fact that POFMA also makes the communication of these false statements, if made knowingly, a criminal offence. Does a Perm Sec want to open up that can of worms with their biggest boss? There's clearly a strong disincentive to. 

**Did Raeesah Khan admit to making highly derogatory statements?**

Without going to Raeesah's underlying posts (which, for the record, I think were misguided but clearly not criminal), the focus on this is what she ""admitted to."" At a press conference on 5 July, Raeesah said: 

&gt;""My intention was never to cause any social division, but to raise awareness to minority concerns. I apologise to any racial group or community who have been hurt by my comments. My remarks were insensitive, and I regret making them. I feel passionate about minority issues, regardless of race, and in my passion, I made improper remarks, and I have to be accountable for them. I will fully cooperate with police investigations.""

On 6 July, the PAP issued a press release stating that:

&gt;""The WP should state its stand on Ms Raeesah's posts, since she has admitted to making highly derogatory statements about Chinese and Christians."" 

There are 2 ways of interpreting the PAP's press release: 

1. Raeesah admitted to making the posts *(but not that they were highly derogatory)*, but the PAP takes the view that the posts were highly derogatory of Chinese and Christians. This is arguably true. 
2. Alternatively - *Raeesah had herself admitted to making highly derogatory statements about Chinese and Christians*. As is clear from her apology above, she did no such thing - at best, she said her remarks were insensitive and improper. This interpretation is untrue.    

Now, which interpretation should we take? Without belabouring the long legal arguments, the law is not clear (as far as I know, it's still developing) - but AGC has argued that so long as one of multiple reasonable meanings is false, a correction direction can be issued notwithstanding that the fact that the other possible meaning are true. So, on this argument, the statement may be taken as false. 

Was it in the public interest to issue the statement? As above, yes, it does appear so - this was a press release in an election cycle. The purpose was clearly to influence how voters vote. 

Again, the criteria have in my view (at least arguably) been met. 

**Is there a better way?** 

Now, some people have said that they agree with the need for POFMA, if not its current form (I don't think we need it all, I think we need an independent media and freedom of information laws to act as a safeguard from abuse - but that's a different debate). If we do need it, what's a better way forward?

Simple - if we're going to keep this law, any affected person should be able to file an application to have a POFMA direction issued. And the courts should be the arbiter at first instance of whether or not the direction should be issued. There could be special provisions made for cases to be brought on an extra-quick basis if the falsehoods need to be remedied. 

The Constitution provides that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law. Right now, it doesn't feel like POFMA does that. This proposal would restore parity to some degree - in my examples above, the affected persons (i.e. an opposition party, or Raeesah) would be able to apply for a POFMA direction to be issued. The court can decide whether or not the direction is warranted. This would go a long way to making the legislation fair and workable.

This was after their success with using these issues  in the 2011 election with regards to the government's immigration policies. Yet this was a political misjudgment that ultimately hurt their parties and benefited the PAP.

First of all goverment policy has u-turned since the 2011 election and worries about the same influx seem rather mute because of covid-19 having basically stopped all immigration. The dorm outbreak has made many of us sympathetic to foregin labour and realize the reliance we have on foreign labour, this, of course, creates support for reducing our dependence on it but also creates public sympathy for them.

By taking such a broad anti-immigrant stance they not only alienate immigrants but the family members and friends of immigrants who often are native Singaporeans.

Policies like hire sinkie first, fire sinkie last might have support in places like EDMW and reddit but lack any credibility with most people.

I doubt I can take the JPAE route cuz I used it back in 2017 when I wasn't sure if LASALLE would accept me, I got an offer from RP but I rejected it to go to LASALLE.

I could try DAE but tbh my hopes aren't too high since my GPA from ITE is 2.7. At the most I'll get into a course in RP.

I considered Work-Study Diplomas but I'm limited to a small selection of business courses (due to my ITE cert) and the ones which I'm interested in are in the Aviation sector and with this COVID situation, that industry is pretty dead at the moment which won't bode well for me.

I'm considering taking O-Level as I see it as a form of a ""reset"" button. I would be able to apply to more local poly courses and pursue a major which I'm interested in. ( I'm very keen to study security studies in uni)

I'll be 23 by the time I ORD. I would love to hear any advice you guys have.",,Is it worth it to take Private O Levels after ORD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i3klsv/is_it_worth_it_to_take_private_o_levels_after_ord/

i7ygmx,1597174621,i7ygmx,13,,"Hi im currently 16 retained in sec 3 so i just need some advice rn  im in NA stream

i stopped going because i had alot of people i disliked in class and they also dont really like me either 

i used to have friends but they just stop talking to me i dont think i did anything wrong i just didnt know how to handle the situation and i really really disliked being seen by them or being close them wouldnt be a stretch to say i hate them , i get stressed in school or any place with people i worry about being judged for my appearance or how they perceive me i might have social anxiety i've seen a  Psychiatrist before but all he did was give me ""Happy Pills"" for my depression (not trying to be that kind of person who lists 100 mental issues)  but that didnt work i know very stupid reason to stop going to school 

so recently after the corona thing got better i came back to school i didnt attend this year until the corona situation got better and of course i  didnt make any friends since no one talked to me they probably look down on me for being the ""new"" guy i cant really start conversations with people either since i have really really bad trust issues i dont feel the need to make friends but after i think 3 weeks of attending like 3-4 days / week i stopped attending again im not sure i just really find it hard to attend school 

the people at school have tried to help like letting me go to a room at recess or allowing me to skip certain periods that i've chosen but after awhile it stopped helping 

i know the obvious thing to do is just attend school and pass End of year exam its just 2 -3 months and possibly pass the grade and move on to 4N but at this rate im probably going to 4NT or retain for another year 

i think the hardest part for me about school is the large quantity of students , my current class has about 40 people i think and the classroom itself is pretty compact i find it hard to just be in school just because there are lots of people having to walk out of class 

as for subjects i really havent learned anything to pass my english is fine my math is shit i might pass bio n chem but my sec 3 basics arent there my passing criteria is 3 subjects and my counselor said smth about end of year being my majority of the subject like if i pass the english eoe i pass the subject 

&amp;#x200B;

im also not really motivated to attend school or bother with life i was originally thinking of just enjoying the time i have left until NS and just end it there since i dont really wanna go to NS but no choice

My parents are in their 50's they are worried about me they cant do much to help me either since no one can help me but myself so i dont really know what to do i also dont know what to do as a job or whatever i never thought about this until now since no one filled the blanks in at the time 

all i do at home is play games on steam watch youtube and godforbid anime but i feel closest to what is happiness to me when im alone 

i feel really bad about myself my parents try to make me happy like they bought some PC parts for me when i asked them but i didnt really do anything to deserve it im just extra stress on their wallets and minds 

im also really physically insecure i dont like showing my face i suck at making eye contact 

whenever i go out in public i can manage some what i can order food atleast but i really really cannot form a sentence at school 

i wouldnt say its bullying but i guess it counts in Sec 1-2 the same people who dislike me used to be friends with me usually im the one that gets teased or picked on one of em would squeeze or kick my balls sometimes or ride my back and he would punch me for fun sometimes it would leave a mark i was too nice at the time 

the others would call me names or spread rumors abt me one of em pulled my uniform's shirt and the button came off iirc one of em stuck their finger in my ass once but failed if anything it made my butt hurt because why not he got punished for it but eh he also peed on the floor for fun in the boys toilet because he can if anything his whole personality was ooo i make people laugh because i can it is the only way to identify myself as me 

one of em  i could call a friend but he just stopped talking to me after i blocked him on \*social media app\* even though it wasnt the first time i did so i did it because he was sharing shit with the other guy who tried to poke my butthole and i didnt like him doing that because i think he's a cunt so i jokingly blocked him and was planning to unblock him later but eh he just stopped talking to me over a small thing",,Need some advice rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i7ygmx/need_some_advice_rn/

I’m currently on a gap year after my Bachelors in architecture and I’m considering moving on to urbanism / urban planning instead of the usual MArch. I was feeling quite powerless in the wake of many things that have happened since the start of this year - Australian bushfires, ecological devastation, floods, covid-19, political unrest, etc - and I thought I should start actually doing more for the community instead of designing structures or landscapes for developers in a local firm. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question to urban planners or local urban planning grads: 

1. Where do you work? I assume the biggest player in this game is URA. I know of some smaller firms that specialise in planning too but I’m not too sure.
2. How is your work life there? What are some of the things you do as a planner?
3. Do you feel fulfilled? I’m certainly quite afraid how I might be motivated and passionate now, but I might be burnt out later in life.
4. Was there anything in your line of work that you didn’t expect to have?
5. And lastly, do you feel like you’re paid well for the work you do? I currently work for a small firm with a BArch pay. I used to think it was alright but after long hours, all-nighters and migraines… yea my pay’s not good

So here comes the context. I have a classmate who can't keep his mouth shut about how much he spends on Grab / Starbucks on a daily basis and boasted about having 6 girlfriends (treating each of them $50 mala.)

Out of all the nonsense he says about himself, there's this one that stands out the most. He says that the reason why he has all this spending money is because he worked under contract in a (government?) tax related job that lets him earn 4 figures per month. He also stated that during the pandemic, he had nothing to do at work and practically uses phone most of the time **because Covid**.

I've already debunked his previous bullshit statement stating he was a blackbelt taekwando when he said there were 10+ forms for him to maste (Fact check: blackbelts have 9 forms only). Now I'm just writing a list of how much shit he's trying to blow smoke up people's ass.

I've been working on building AskDr, which is a healthcare community platform promoting reliable medical information through our verified doctors. We recently launched open beta at the Smart Nation &amp; U Festival in November and have been preparing for our v1 launch based on the feedback collected ever since.

One of the main reasons why we started the site is to fight medical misinformation. In light of the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak, we noticed there were a lot of fake news or misinformation floating around through whatsapp and other places online, which has the potential to cause panic, spread bad practices or clear out shelves of maggi mee :) In essence, it urged us to rush out some revamps so that we can quickly provide a medium where anyone can connect with verified doctors to get tips, be pointed in the right direction or debunk medical myths regarding the topic.

We want to be able to centralise the collective knowledge in this space through questions asked so that people can refer to it at anytime or bring offline discussions online in hopes of bringing resolve to more people! So if you have questions, we would really appreciate if you can share it and start a conversation that could potentially help others! (You may ask anonymously with an unidentifiable display name)

I really hope this is something that could benefit people in our society and if you have feedback on how we could improve, don't hold back, I'm all ears! 🙏

fk54ay,1584451198,fk54ay,14,,"I'm a teenage singaporean myself and honestly I'm disappointed about Singaporeans complain culture.

Undoubtedly, the complain culture shapes our way of life and is definitely representative of who we are. However, the recent outbreak of Covid-19 has no doubt showed that the complain culture is one that is scary.

The recent increase in covid-19 cases in Singapore have almost more than half of them made up by ""imported cases"". By definition, imported cases refers to cases that had been infected overseas and brought into Singapore; It includes foreigners, Long Term Pass holders, PRs and even Singaporeans themselves.

My biggest problem is that many Singaporeans have selective reading. They read what they want to read (which in most cases, is the headline/title of the article), and not the content, and jump to ridiculous conclusions. In times of crises, instead of being humane and supportive of actions, such as helping our Malaysian workers to find accomodation so they can still work and contribute to our economy, as well as taking personal responsibility in preventing the spread of covid-19, these people only sit behind keyboards and complain. Another thing is the issue on wearing masks. The very reason we were told not to wear masks if we were unwell is because we have a limited stockpile that is needed to support our healthcare and frontline workers (just imagine, a 5.5 million population multiplied by two masks a day because u need to change the masks every now and then, that's 11 million masks a day), and we are not like China; we don't have the capabilities to set up a factory in ten days due to land limitations, yet when asked to propose a better solution, they offer nothing better. They only want things to go their way, but they dont think of the long term impacts of their recommendations.

I'm not a hundred percent supportive of everything that's being done, but certainly it's not that easy to propose foolproof solutions at this time isit? Going into lockdown, for example, means closure of shops all over Singapore; you certainly don't want such inconveniences do you?

My name is Johnathan, I'm reaching out on behalf of a team of analysts advising health organizations and agencies in their fight against Covid-19. Our objective is to gather data and information on how different countries deal with and fight the pandemic - and through that hopefully advise others how they can better fight Covid-19. Since Singapore is relatively dealing well with the current outbreak, we are eager to learn from you.

**We would like to ask for your help with recommendations for sources, experts and/or websites that we could learn from about Covid-19 in Singapore.**

**Also, we would like to hear from you and from your personal knowledge**, every little piece of information can help:

* **Public space** \- Are you allowed outside? must you wear masks or gloves if so? Is there still public transportation? Are there public disinfection sites outside? Does the government disinfect public places?
* **Getting checked** \- How are people being checked for the virus? What technology is being used to check? Where do people go to, to get checked? How do you decide who needs to get checked?
* **Using quarantine** \- What steps were taken and when? Who is placed under quarantine? Who still can go to work? How is the quarantine enforced? Are people under surveillance?
* **Learning from the past** \- What did you learn from SARS? How were you better prepared for Covid-19? Do you have special ""National alertness"" stages? what do they mean?
* **Medical personnel** \- How are medical personnel and their families are being kept safe?
* **Contact tracing** \- How is ""contact tracing"" done? How do you trace the paths of people who became sick and might have contaminated others?

That's it for now - If you are able to help us with these questions, if you know some sources or websites where we can find data and information, or know someone who is an expert in the field and is willing to help - we would appreciate it greatly.

For example:

- Toys or educational material for your children (my son is 9 months and luckily we bought him tons of toys. I thought we would be spoiling him but it’s a lifesaver now when we run out of ideas to entertain him).

- Cook books because you might as well cook at home more instead of tapow so often.

- Craft material for anyone interested in learning to paint or crochet etc. Even model kits! Gawd I wish I bought a Zoids kit while I was window-shopping now that I’ve discovered they move again.

- Video game consoles for people who will suddenly have loads of time to play soon.

- Exercise equipment for the family. Exercise is important to keep our immune systems up, so don’t go full-potato with those video games.

gpnoro,1590317322,gpnoro,14,,"Hi,

I just want to confirm regarding the Freight and Insurance pricing incurred to parcels being sent from overseas via Forwarder Services, since it seems that MyUS and VPost are charging vastly different pricing for the item that has caused one to be subject under GST, with the other.

Due to my recent delivery with MyUS, I've just known that Singapore has a GST Relief for Parcel deliveries that has a total value of &lt; $400 SGD, as indicated in [this article](https://www.gov.sg/article/is-it-true-that-i-have-to-pay-gst-on-items-purchased-overseas), and it seems that this total value refers to the CIF value of the parcel after including the freight/shipment fee as well, as defined [here](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes--fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/establishing-the-customs-value#CIF)

The thing that confuses me is how the CIF value for parcels from US is actually obtained for forwarder services, as I'm having a very different experience between MyUS and VPost. 

To start, I had a parcel with a value of $255 USD sent via VPost to Singapore sometime around last August 2019. For their service, the total amount charged for the delivery fee was an understandable $45-ish SGD for a door-to-door service. Adding up the [total pricing in SGD](https://imgur.com/a/k8MQweG), VPost's charges for the item doesn't seem to include significant rates for the freight/delivery, hence the CIF value of the item overall was &lt; $400 SGD, making the item applicable for GST Relief. I didn't get any additional charges beyond this for the whole forwarding transaction.

What then baffles me was that recently I had a cheaper item, valued at $246 USD that was sent via MyUS. At first, MyUS seem to have charged me a fair delivery price of [$21 USD]() with their Budget Economy option, and this seems to include door-to-door delivery service. They then had then parcel sent via Freight Mark, and everything seemed to be going well (minus the fact that it was delayed due to the pandemic). 

Then just this week, I got a phone call from HumAnize Logistics - they seem to be handling the local delivery of the parcel in SG - who told me that additional GST charges was applicable for my parcel, for around $61 SGD, as can be seen in this album [here](https://imgur.com/a/F5wameT). They claim that the reasoning behind this GST being applied is that my parcel's whole CIF value was beyond the $400 SGD Threshold for the GST Relief, citing the usage of the 24.5% Freight &amp; Insurance [Flat rates](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes--fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/flat-rates-for-freight-and-insurance) for US items according to SG Customs rules. Breaking it down, he mentioned that this means my parcel's total CIF was around (246 * 1.41)SGD * (100% + 24.5%) = $431.8 SGD due to this additional flat-rate incurred. 

I was definitely surprised by this additional charge, as I then mentioned that my previous transaction with VPost (admittedly a different forwarder) for a more expensive parcel was somehow not incurring as much CIF, thus relieving it of GST. He then mentioned that different forwarders/couriers might apply different Freight &amp; Insurance rate, so this could be one explanation.

My question here is especially for others who had used MyUS's Budget Economy previously for US-based parcels: Is this kind of CIF pricing normal with the Budget Economy from MyUS? If so, how come the Freight &amp; Insurance is this high when compared to VPost's total CIF? Is it indeed because HumAnize Logistics is just using the standard flat-rate? Also, is it possible that since VPost is under SingPost (which is basically SG's national courier delivery service), that any kind of Freight &amp; Insurance Flat Rate that would normally be applicable is somehow lessened?

Please do note that I'm not saying that MyUS is trying to scam me or being a bad service here. It's just that I'm genuinely shocked and curious as to why is my seemingly cheaper parcel was getting hit with a GST charge when using MyUS, while my previously more expensive parcel was able to be relieved of it when I was using VPost.",,Question regarding Freight and Insurance pricing on parcels from US using Forwarder Services: MyUS vs VPost,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gpnoro/question_regarding_freight_and_insurance_pricing/

1)  Ate at a restaurant with a few friends when Phase 2 started. One of my friends (let's call him B) blew his nose into a tissue and threw the mucus-stained tissue on one of the plates, with the intention for the staff to help him clear it. I was disgusted beyond belief, and was bewildered how none of my other 2 friends even batted an eyelid at that. With all 4 of us having gone through education up till JC, I thought that we might have at least picked up basic hygiene etiquette from somewhere. Even when I called B out and told him to throw the tissue himself, he didn't even seem the least bit embarrassed, and still left the tissue on the table afterwards.

2) This happened today at another place at the table beside me where 2 ladies were eating, who I assume are office workers based on their dressing and the things that they spoke about. This case was even worse, with one of the ladies wiping her mouth and blowing her nose into multiple tissues, and throwing them onto a plate. She even took the time to slowly arrange the tissues into a nice pattern on the plate lmao. I admire the effort (sense the sarcasm), but maybe that would have been better spent throwing your tissues elsewhere, and not letting the staff touch your mucus-stained tissue? While I'm disgusted at her actions, I'm also quite angry at myself for not calling her out. Seeing the staff touching her germs really pained me, and reminded me not to hesitate so much and call out such actions next time.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I need to reason why people should stop this unhygienic practice, even though it's quite common sense to me. It's just basic courtesy to throw your own tissue, which also requires no effort. Put yourself in the shoes of the staff - how would you feel if you had to touch the germs of others? To put it simply, it's plain disgusting, and it's also a sure-fire way for the staff to contract the virus if the customer has it. Furthermore, you might be passing on the virus to the next customer who touches the table, or uses the utensils. Yea sure, you might think that you confirm won't catch the virus and that your snot/saliva is the cleanest of them all, but no one know for sure...you don't want to be that guy who regrets not taking the necessary precautions when you actually have the virus and 'shit hits the fan'.",,Please dispose your dirty tissues properly when dining-in!,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hfiylv/please_dispose_your_dirty_tissues_properly_when/

hlpfjq,1593966590,hlpfjq,14,,"With the knee jerk and rather harsh attacks/counterattacks made by the incumbent against Raeesah Khan for her old social media posts and Paul Tambyah for his observations on COVID 19, that utilise the full weight of the government machinery (Racial Harmony Penal Code and POFMA respectively), my question is, is our government capable of operating in the prescence of criticism?

I would like to believe that it is, but the recent events have shaken my trust. 

Here I would like to cite a defence for certain elements of the PAP government in order to criticise others. PM Lee, MOE's Ong Ye Kung and even the controversial Mom's Josephine Teo have all made moves during COVID that in hindsight were not the best. (Advising against masks, not shutting schools and the enter Foreign Worker Dorm situation respectively). 

They have all faced harsh criticism for those decisions after the fact and have made the necessary adjustments accordingly. In light of the limitations they faced in the moment and the rather speedy response to the criticisms afterwards (recalibration of mask policies and distribution of masks, focused transition to E learning, New regulations regarding dorm conditions) those criticisms have largely been resolved, the general sentiment towards these Ministers have become positive again (with the exception of Josephine Teo, but I think the Jalan Besar vote will most likely vindicate her), and Singapore benefits as a result. 

This is the behaviour we should be encouraging. When Ministers acknowledge and respond to criticisms of their shortcomings with sharp policy corrects (even if they don't explicitly apologise) . For these specific Ministers, we should ensure their continued Mandate, for they have indeed done well for us. 

However, there appears to be emerging another strategy to respond to criticisms that the Government may have misstepped, which is to utilise the various instruments of government to reconstruct narratives and attack critics. As if to protect the imagination that the PAP is all knowing and has never made mistakes and is never capable of making mistakes. As if this is the only way voters will trust the Government. 

I don't think this is behaviour we ought to encourage, and I think it leads to a generally less desirable state of affairs for Singapore, where the goal of government is not to learn as it encounters new challenges but rather to create conditions of media where they always appear in the right. Yet I can see why the PAP may find this strategy alluring.

It takes a deep trust in the voting population for the Government to take the High Road. To trust that voters will forgive for mistakes corrected, and place higher value in one willing to learn rather than one who is all knowing. I'm not sure all members of the PAP trust us that much, and I'm not sure we have represented ourselves as being so trustworthy either. 

To be completely honest, I like HSK's general policy towards leadership. He does not claim to have all the answers, and instead presents himself as one willing and able to take input from the population and make them actionable in policy. One may imagine that it is only because of his peculiar leadership style that we were able to reach into the reserves to combat COVID 19 with an unprecedented budgeting, instead of just a mere repeat of Goh Chok Tong's SARS policy. 

I suspect the humble and quite respectable PAP general party line of focusing on policy rather than electoral politicking may come from this brand of leadership. I don't think this is a bad thing. 

However should PAP come to the conclusion after this election that it is ruthless politicking/media tactics rather than effective policy that earns votes and assures the seat in Government, then I am afraid that this brand of leadership may die in the cradle and be replaced with something far more authoritarian. After all, HSK for all his virtues in policy seems neither extremely willing nor decently skilled enough to attack his political opponents with strongman political tactics. 

 For the sake of all of us, vote Wisely.

IMO, focus on jobs and business over managing the pandemic is an argument that miss the forest for the tree. It can and will backfire resulting in more job loss, lower business opportunities, affects investor's confidence and negatively affect the economy.

Take US for example which is prioritising business and job over the pandemic. The number of infections had shot up and only a few, if any, countries are willing to open the border to US.

For Singapore, the impact will be worse as we are heavily reliant on trade. Countries which have gotten the pandemic in check and are opening up their borders. However, they will be not be willing to jeopardise their efforts and economy by opening their borders to countries which they deem to be unsafe. This has already negatively impacted Singapore. A number of countries (our major trading partners like EU, Japan, etc) have a 'safe list of countries' which they have set up travel bubble or lifted travel restrictions. Sadly Singapore is not among the countries the list. 

Having said that, it does not mean we can totally ignore jobs and businesses cause it is a balancing act. But the priority should be on the pandemic and when we have shown that we have gotten the pandemic in check, countries will be willing and eager to open up their borders with us and it will lift our economy resulting in more jobs and business opportunities.

I specifically want to rant on these 2 companies that are very irresponsible for either their training to their delivery guy or their delivery practices.

[Simplypost] 

My kitchen knife was assigned to simplypost. Yesterday, I received a notification saying my parcel was delivered. I was surprised. I was at home. No phone call. No bell ring. No door knock. I immediately check with customer service. It says to check my mailbox... So, I opened my door ready to step out, the parcel was right at the middle of my doorstep

[Urbanfox SG] 

A whole package consisting of multiple items and was assigned to Urbanfox. Today, the same thing, received a notification saying my package was delivered. But no calls, no bell ring, etc... I immediately checked outside my doorstep but don't have also... I don't even have to check the mailbox because the package won't fit. When I checked on the Lazada tracking status, it has this ""proof of delivery"" which is a picture of the signature captured. That signature was just a line drawn, not even drawn by me lol. I got no choice but to submit a refund. Shortly after I submitted, my neighbor comes and pass me my package and says is outside her doorstep. I thanked my neighbor for being so honest and awesome. It will be so complicated if she didn't pass it to me.

So, what did I get away from these 2 bad experiences? 

1) They should always call. If they come knocking or ringing bells no one at home, they should call for rescheduling or ask them whether if is it ok to leave it at their doorstep, riser, or even pass it to their neighbors. 

2) They should never leave a parcel outside the doorstep without their consent. Anyone can just passby and grab it 

3) Proof of delivery of signature doesn't work during covid. During covid, most of the delivery guys will just sign on our behalf. And because of this, when packages are not delivered is hard to dispute. They should take a photo of the unit number instead if cannot get a signature. So at least we can see the picture if the delivery guy delivered to the correct unit.

I think pretty much everyone knows that there is actually more people infected with this WARS/Wuhan virus than said by our news outlet. So this is what people should know about it, in points of course. 


1) Currently there are more than 300 new cases per day or per week if I’m not mistaken &amp; a Vaccine for this sort of pathogen will take months if not years because this Virus is common amongst, you guess it right, animals. Yes it’s common amongst animals and animals itself until someone decided to eat a snake that was already infected with the said virus and hence mutated in his blood stream which then lead to the said signs which is fever, cough, flu and so forth. 



2) And why will a vaccine take such a long time to recreate? Simple. To recreate something that is not common or better yet, has never been encountered will be even harder because you never know if the vaccine that you have created will help to eliminate the said virus OR increased it’s mutation speed and hence spreading the virus even faster amongst people hence why it’ll take a while. 




3) so right now, Every country in the world is doing what they should do. Containment till further notice. To decrease the percentage of people being infected with the said virus. But there are also other fears that this virus can be spread amongst utensils and even hand rails and so forth hence why countries like the philiphines had 500 people from china inbound to their airport deported back immediately after landing to prevent the virus from infecting more people which leads to the next point. 




4) Countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia &amp; any country that has been infected or has not yet been infected should close down flights to china &amp; divert flights that are inbound from china, back to where they came from.

ewqr1m,1580487566,ewqr1m,15,,"Recently, as we all know, the Wuhan virus has made its way to Singapore and there are currently around 16 confirmed cases in Singapore, most being Chinese Nationals. It is something that we all do worry about. Parents, students, elderly, we're all talking about it. The government has made some measures and introduced some policies like the travel ban to try and contain the virus and limit it's spread.  
However, recently, after reading through some comments on social media platforms of people giving their opinions on the matter and the comments and actions of the ministers, it really saddens me to see so many people criticizing the ministers, especially Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. I know that it is impossible to always get everyone to be supportive of your statements and actions. But this just didn't seem right to me (to me, my personal opinion, take it with a grain of salt). Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong along with some other ministers said that there is no need for Singaporeans to wear masks if they are not sick and it might be even counter productive.  
This comment made many Singaporeans angry and upset that the ministers are not supporting their belief of ""It's better to be safe than sorry"" and their decision to take all precautions when tackling this new virus. I can understand why, I really do. We all have loved ones, we all have friends, we all do not wish to see people that we love and care being in pain and in a life or death situation. No amount of deaths is ever too small. Life is precious.  
But after analyzing the current situation, the ministers are not wrong. The masks are limited and there is a severe shortage of them. (Note: this is a very important point) We do not have many masks to go around, let alone sustain our extreme precautionary measures for long term. And it's not likely we will be getting an abundance of them anytime soon because other nations are also getting stocked up. Facing this virus, we all should take precautions. Wearing a mask is definitely a precaution and it can offer at least a small amount of protection. But, so far there are no confirmed carriers of the virus that are not being quarantined at hospitals. One of the main ways the virus transmits is through contact. If you touch someone or something with the virus and then touch your face, the virus can enter your body through your nose, eyes or mouth. A mask cannot prevent you from contact with the virus, it just simply can't. One way to beat that is just to frequently wash your hands with soap. The other way it is transmitted is through coughs, etc. One extremely popular belief is that the standard face masks (the surgical ones) protect you from the virus. There has been little evidence that supports that claim. The actual purpose of wearing the mask is to prevent the spread of the virus when you are a suspected carrier or when you are sick (to prevent people being paranoid). And this is exactly what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in the interview. The masks should be reserved for those that are unwell and those who are fighting the virus on the front lines (doctors, nurses, etc). The masks that actually ""protect"" you from the virus are the N95 masks, not the surgical ones.

Since there is a shortage of masks, it is important to use them wisely. Right now, the situation is being handled well, and there is a very low chance you will get infected just by going outside. And if we start using the bulk of our supply right now, it would be catastrophic when there are actually confirmed cases outside hospitals and an outbreak starts in Singapore.

When the situation worsens, everyone wearing a mask is definitely warranted and I firmly believe that the government would support that. But right now, the chances of infection are still too low for that, and if we run out of masks later on, our own strategy and selfishness to ""protect"" ourselves by wearing masks when there's no need to would become our ultimate downfall.

Just like this virus situation, we buy a fire extinguisher to keep at home in order to protect us from fires when they start by putting them out. We do not buy fire extinguishers to spray around the house to prevent a fire. Bear in mind, we only have 1 fire extinguisher, and that single fire extinguisher is for us to keep and use when we need it. Don't use it before the house is on fire. Don't waste your masks.

Stay vigilant, not anxious. Use masks wisely.

f0rf47,1581167656,f0rf47,15,,"Im probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this but well...here goes my opinion

A few days ago, the orange alert was launched. Many Singaporeans went out immediately to stock up on food items such as maggi mee, rice, toilet paper, canned food etc. Same thing with the mask situation. Once hearing about the Wuhan CoV reaching SG, droves of people went out to immediately stock up on masks. 

I feel that this reaction is fair and should not be vilified.

Here's my reasoning. Our prime instinct is to survive. We ensure our safety and security. This is why Singaporeans went out to stock up; its because they want to prepare themselves for survival. Singaporean's survival instinct kicked in. Many say that these actions are selfish. But lets ask it in a different manner. If someone was about to punch you, would you raise up your hands to defend yourself or wait for him to punch you before attempting to recover and stop the pain? Singapore's food supply might not be in danger as of now, but what if (far-fetched but still possible ) the rice supply is destroyed by rats. Or the facilities are destroyed due to an accident. Then what happens? SG food supply might be secure now but anything can happen that might endanger our very survival.

We preempt ourselves for the worse. That in the case of an unknown circumstance that we will be capable to overcome the problem. This is the mentality that Singaporean's have that results in us rushing to purchase food supplies. Prevention is better than cure. It is better to prepare now rather than in the future panicking and perhaps even at the very worse Singapore's food supply is no longer secure. This is why I personally feel that this entire situation of many people rushing to buy items to prepare themselves for the worst is completely reasonable and should not be vilified.

**Note:** I believe that the Singaporean's response to rush out to buy food is completely reasonable. However I do not feel that riding on the increased demand of items to increase the price of your goods is acceptable, as shown on carousell when you search the term ""masks"".

There a few dorms where the number of positive swabs are so high (such as S11) that statistically if someone presents with respiratory symptoms, they are highly likely to be infected with covid and therefore there is not much point to confirming via swabs testing as these swabs can then be used for other unknown cases including those who are asymptomtic. 

**What does this mean in terms of the total number of daily cases?**

It means that the number of cases for example today which was around 600 does not represent the true number of cases since these are only cases confirmed via swabs. It is possible that several hundred more cases have been confirmed to have covid via clinical diagnosis

Yes and no. These clinically confirmed cases seem to just be carried out in dorms, however, as far as I know anyway, people in the community are still being confirmed solely via swabs

No. Please bare in mind the current situation for everyone is extremely difficult and the workload for doctors, nurses, cleaners, volunteers including dentists etc is very heavy.

Hi. I'm a 16 year old and ive got bipolar disorder, constantly anxious of everything every decision is fucking apparent to me. Feels like Reddit is the epicentre where all us depressed people gather(not a bad things at all, in fact it's pretty good) since we are all in this together and the bulk of us can't share how we feel to 99.9% of the people we know. I feel in lucky that I was able to alert this to of 2 of my best friends since secondary school.

The entire Inside Out thing hits so close to home... I always found my inner voice which is my emotions talking to me all the time, doesnt even feel like emotions anymore. 

Have cried alone a lot of the times and I feel that ive hit so many rough patches alone. Ran away from home like 7  times already , nearly died trying to kill myself a few times, my mum even nearly found my suicide note in a wallet, it was a close call. 

(Oh yeah, forgot to mention it) I always talk to my cousin, he's like a brother to me about everything.. really has made me grow and become more mature cus we draw up plans for the future and always vent to him about how I feel. 

With regard to this CB, I kinda love staying at home cus I always feel comfortable at home with noone bothering me and yes, I have  no social life. Have never really went out after school during secondary school and now I'm in Jc. But at the same time I always feel I'm missing out on alot when it comes to going out.


(This part is about who I really am as a person irl)

The reason why I'm saying this is cus I always feel like a person looks reflects their personality, but it for me it doesn't 



As you read this you'd garner an impression of me and maybe even carve out a face to what you'd think id look like as a depressed homebody guy. But it's odd considering that people think im some Bufflord who gyms alot and is really outgoing (have large shoulders and large thighs) I gym a lot and managed to gain a  'ideal body type' (stocky) also because I have a pretty clean diet which is to do with a lot of healthy eating and no eating outside of home food. I also have a deep voice. But never felt that it was really ME cus i think of myself as a carefree person who is just trying to have fun. But i don't look like that nor does my voice refect that, so I change my voice, to sound like a more carefree person ( I know it's fucked up, but yes I can sound like a totally different person by changing my voices - (used to do
 this and prank call my teachers)

Everytime I change my voice it's like I changed my personality like I have Dissociative Identity Disorder... Like the movie Split, where one guy has many distinct personalities..except that the movie has got so aspects of it wrong 

Thanks for reading my post where I'm just about how I'm coping and  how's my life going,


Edit: just wanted to add this: And my way of coping when Im losing mind and I have all those emotions acting as my inner voice is to listen to Coldplay songs (the only songs I listen to, some say I don't have taste in music) they are the only band that I truly syncs with how I'm feeling

gr8srv,1590537869,gr8srv,15,,"Singapore faces its sharpest contraction since independence after the city-state warned that its economy could shrink by 7 per cent in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 

After initially winning international praise for its efforts to control the spread of the virus, the number of cases in Singapore has soared.

The infection rate among the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories, who have driven the surge in coronavirus patients, is now approaching 10 per cent.

There are 32,343 cases in Singapore, one of the highest rates on a per capita basis in Asia. Dormitory residents account for more than 90 per cent of total infections. 

The virus is dragging down the economy. The Ministry of Trade and Industry said on Tuesday that it expected gross domestic product to fall between 4 per cent and 7 per cent in 2020. It had previously projected a contraction of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. 

“The outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened further since March,” the MTI said.

“Notwithstanding the downgrade, there continues to be a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the Covid-19 outbreak, as well as the trajectory of the economic recovery, in both the global and Singapore economies.”

If GDP growth contracts by 5 per cent or more this year, it would mark the steepest fall since Singapore’s independence from Malaysia in 1965.

“It is almost certain that it’s going to be the worst [drop since independence], short of a miracle or a vaccine very soon,” said Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank.

Heng Swee Keat, the finance minister, on Tuesday announced a fourth support package of S$33bn (US$23bn) involving relief measures for businesses and households after Singapore’s small, open economy was buffeted by a lockdown. The country’s four support packages total almost S$100bn, or nearly 20 per cent of GDP. 

Sectors including construction — which relies heavily on migrant workers — transportation, wholesale and retail trade all shrank in the first quarter of the year. The accommodation and food services sector contracted by an annualised 69.9 per cent from the previous three months, its biggest fall on record.

“Singapore does not have a domestic tourism market,” said Mr Chua. “Ultimately any kind of lift-off, especially for hospitality and aviation, will require a relaxation of border controls which is the most difficult part of this exit from lockdown.”

But Mr Chua added that the expansion in biomedical manufacturing, finance and insurance in the first quarter suggested that those sectors could help offset the “negative hit” from the shutdown.

Singapore will gradually reopen schools and select businesses on Tuesday. Companies in sectors such as finance, insurance and logistics that meet safety requirements may reopen next month, while businesses including retail shops or entertainment venues will remain closed for at least another four weeks.

Calvin was the one talking until a slide showed up and i've started to doubt the legitimacy of the couple's preaching. 

The graph shows (according to Calvin) that according to the US National Bank's data shows the slow elevating growth of E-commerce % of retail sales for the past 10 years until recently the beginning of the Covid-19 era which there is a very suspicious spiking growth of % of sales due to the masses heavily depending on online trade to buy and sell.

However with all excitement set aside, most attendees fail to notice that the graph is of an annual nature. so why in the world ""April 2020"" manage to exist in an annual chart? isn't this criminal to manipulate data in the name of the USA's national bank simply to proof how profitable it is to do e-commerce? look at that sharp spike, it looks super exaggerated! how can one compare data of 1 year to 8 weeks? do they not know how big is a year's data compared to 8 weeks'? if they can manipulate data in such a way they could have just add months of 2020 to compare to each year starting from 2009.

eynxb2,1580810797,eynxb2,16,,"SINGAPORE - Singapore has recorded its first cases of local coronavirus transmission, with four women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

Two work at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop in Cavan Road in Lavender which caters to Chinese tour groups.

The third is a maid of one of the women, while the fourth is a tour guide who had taken groups to the same shop.

The tour group in question has since returned to China.

In addition, another two confirmed cases were announced on Tuesday (Feb 4).

The two were among a group of 92 people flown back to Singapore from Wuhan on a Scoot flight last Thursday. Before this, another two on the same flight had been reported as confirmed cases.

In total, there are now 24 confirmed cases in Singapore.


The new cases constitute ""limited local transmission"", the Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

""There is however no widespread evidence of widespread community transmission,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at a press conference.

""It is possible that there could be broader community spread despite our best efforts,"" he told reporters.

Should that happen, Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, and paring down non-essential care services, to slow the spread of disease.

The country has been preparing for such clusters, and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters, to the broader community, MOH said.

As surveillance has been stepped up, more such local clusters are expected, including more cases of local transmission, it added.

The ministry has also started contact tracing so as to ringfence the cluster and limit further spread.

Cases with limited community transmission are not unexpected, said Mr Gan, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force to defend the country against the virus.

""This is a scenario which we are prepared for,"" he said, noting that efforts will help reduce the risk of escalation.

""As the situation evolves we will step up our posture accordingly to further contain the situation in Singapore.""

With local transmission happening here, the Government is stepping up cleaning of public areas, as well as measures to lower the risk for vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly.

To keep students safe, for instance, schools will implement staggered recess times, and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps. Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large-scale gatherings.

As an added precaution, the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China.

In addition, all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, since last week.

Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals, and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility. Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often, especially high-traffic areas.

The earlier 18 confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported, comprising 16 Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.

One has been discharged, said the ministry on Tuesday.

The update was given after a two-day lull on Sunday and Monday, when no new cases were reported.

The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community, it must prepare for a long fight against the virus, Mr Gan told Parliament on Monday.

It was first reported in Wuhan late last year. As of Monday, it had infected more than 20,000 people and claimed over 420 lives, mainly in China.

Outside mainland China, there have been close to 300 cases and two deaths, one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Global authorities have warned of more person-to-person spread, with the United States, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission.

On Tuesday, Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10. They said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China - including one from Wuhan. But he showed symptoms only on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia.

Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than Sars, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at the Wuhan's South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission.

Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non-essential travel to China, while visitors with recent travel to China or those with Chinese passports will not be allowed entry.

The six new cases:

- The 19th case is a 28-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who had no recent travel history to China. She works as a salesperson at health product shop Yong Thai Hang at 24, Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, that primarily served Chinese tourists.

She developed a sore throat and fever last Wednesday (Jan 29) and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) last Thursday, but was discharged from hospital after her chest X-Ray result came back negative for pneumonia.

She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Friday to Sunday and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.

- The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She lived at Hougang Street 61 and also worked at Yong Thai Hang.

She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Monday.

- The 21st case is a 44-year-old Indonesian woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She is the domestic helper of case 19, and stayed with her employer in her home at Jalan Bukit Merah. She reported symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her home since then.

She was admitted to SGH on Monday.

The 22nd and 23rd cases are Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. They did not have symptoms when they boarded the flight and were quarantined when they landed in Singapore.

The two cases tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday even though they still showed no symptoms.

They are now warded in isolation rooms at NCID.

All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were, as an added precaution, tested for the coronavirus.

Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singapore resident who has no recent travel history in China.

She is a tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang, the same shop where cases 19 and 20 worked.

The tour guide did not show any symptoms when she went to NCID on Monday. She was immediately isolated and is now warded in an isolation room in the centre.

She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday afternoon.

As a student in JC, I've seen many not wearing masks (even in the canteen during peak break periods), not really caring about washing hands with soap regularly, and not abiding by the rule of sitting a seat apart during lectures (this is the rule enforced for social distancing). Meanwhile, my parents' generation (50+ years old) are executing so many hygiene practices. From washing hands with soap immediately after coming home (first thing to do before anything else), to keeping up with the news on the number of cases in Singapore, to doing 'house arrests' to their children so that they do not go out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, I'm making a general observation. Of course, some adolescents care about COVID a lot, and vice versa. I don't think anyone is wrong or right (I personally care about COVID enough to follow some basic practices, but not to the extent of being so 'germophobic'). But my question is:

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT CAUSED THE SPLIT IN MENTALITY TOWARDS THIS COVID SITUATION?**

&amp;#x200B;

For the older generation, perhaps they:

\- Care about their children so much, that they take this situation seriously

\- Have gone through such an epidemic in 2003 (SARS), so they are more cautious

&amp;#x200B;

For the younger generation (mine), perhaps they:

\- Are getting irritated at their parents' diligent care (to the extent of forcing children to not go out with friends), hence in rebellion, they show that COVID is not that serious of an issue to warrant such cautious measures

\- Are also irritated that school life has changed drastically. 'MASS ACTIVITIES CANCELLED' screams out a lot of pain for students who were looking forward to school events (orientation, especially orientation).

\- Have not understood the severity of the situation (not caught up on the news? was not alive to experience SARS epidemic?)

One example is the Jurong Safra dinner and the other is Malaysia's 16k major gathering which on hindsight, people will say why wasn't it cancelled or at least precaution taken for intimate contacts given the COVID19 situation, though before that not many people (at least the non-muslims) know about this activity at all.

One activity that I can think of is the upcoming chinese Tomb sweeping festival (Qing Ming) in early April. I tombsweep in Malaysia so the experience may differ from Singaporeans. Do let me know if there actually am not too much concern on social distancing with the Qing Ming activity in Singapore.

During QingMing weekends, the causeway will be jammed and packed with ppl returning to malaysia for tombsweeping. During the actual day, we will bring tools and food to the ancestor's tombgrave, do some clearing of weeds and some clean up, and offer the food for praying, with the food brought back and consume later in malaysia home. The cemetry is usually packed during the season with people. Besides the close proximity with people, the other possible source of spread can be the contamination of the food, although most of the food should be cover with plastic wraps to prevent the Chinense Joystick ashes normally that reduce this risk.

The increased lack in physical distance is likely to lead to feelings of isolation. The lack of intimacy will also cause relationship problems. As humans, we use a lot of talking and venting to deal with our emotional problems - that's why gathering of men to drink beer, women sharing gossips...

Also, the fluidity of changes in policy dealing with COVID is starting to cause uncertainty - I know the government doesn't have a choice though.

If not managed well, before we even clear COVID, there might be a spike in mental health concerns. Depression and anxiety is going to set in - IMH should already start preparing the capacity.

3. Change of air con systems in shops and offices, much like the aircon options we have in cars (internal circulation only/let air outside air in for exchange). If the technology for air circulation to be sanitized of virus and bacteria is ready and effective in big spaces, and expel air inside to outside like cooking exhaust, that would be even better.

4.UV light is not good for human, causing cancer in the long run so don't turn it on permanently in house/shop. However, it is good for sterilization in the absence of humans/human wear proper protective gear. Shine UV light on groceries before they are placed on shelves, UV light on buses whenever they reach the interchange, and restaurants can shine them on the tables and chairs, toilets during break intervals.

5. Hologram type Lift buttons can be added, cool uh...But keep the manual type as backup in case hologram technical error.

6. Installation of cabinets outside homes for contactless food, Qoo10 deliveries etc. I.e. delivery guys will leave your stuff in your cabinet and take photo send u confirmation.

I’m 28 this year and have been working as a bank frontliner for almost 3 years and am taking my degree in a private university part-time.Recently during this CB period I’ve been re-deployed to other department to assist with necessary services.

But it has set me thinking on finding a proper career path for myself. I don’t find myself enjoying my work, more like it’s an “iron rice bowl” during times like this. I don’t see much promotion opportunities in my field of work and hence I set out to study a degree to see if I may eventually find something I’d like to do. But till now I am still pretty much lost in this aspect, I’m using my free time to look around and study a bit of python programming myself so I can keep up with digitalisation (it might come in handy someday).

But at this age I feel like I am playing catch up with time, as with my experience there isn’t much path I can take besides going into frontline jobs which typically already has a Low barrier of entry, yet I am keen to get out of my industry in search of other career in hope that I’ll find somewhere I like and stay.

First, we can all agree that these are trying times. There is cause for frustration, even anger, with everything going on right now.  I'm fearful for the physical *and* mental health of my friends and relatives.  I'm worried about the economy.    I don't feel like the ""normal"" we have been used to will ever return, in the same way 911 fundamentally changed air travel.  I'll also share that despite my tone, the past few months have greatly affected my health in negative ways.

One of the things I'm most proud of is the overall pragmatism of our people and our government (in that order).  The world is constantly going mad, but here the voice, let alone the power of extreme ideologies are not provided space to grow.  We don't have armed white (or if you want, Chinese-race) militias who get to openly bare fangs and provide a climate of fear.  We also don't allow unfounded fears to drive our policies (I'm thinking of ""death squads"" regarding Obama's healthcare policies), and that ""alternative facts"" or the real kind of ""fake news"" aren't allowed to fester our airways.

This positive feeling about our fellow citizens is being challenged around recent discussions about a potential mandatory, physical device for contact tracing.  Instead of voices echoing pragmatic, logical reasoning mixed in with an understanding of our cultural sensitivities, I feel like I'm reading a lot of fear-driven reactions that prohibit positive progress we could be making.  I also don't think I'm alone.

I realize I'm immediately likely to offend people here, but my first reaction is that many of these conversations sound like...  arguments from the anti-vax community about why they don't believe vaccinations should be mandatory, and as a result, follow their misguided beliefs, sometimes to devastating consequences.  I'm extremely glad this isn't a concern here when in many parts of North America vaccinations can fall below thresholds of effectiveness.

**You can yell at me and tell me I'm wrong.  I'm open to that.**  Below, I'll touch on the notions I've read from various people here, and suggest why I don't believe these concerns should scare you.  It's too early to suggest that you should adopt such a device if it should come - like many of you suggest, we need more details - but I do feel that the antagonistic stand many are already taking has the very real possibility of preventing us from making progress towards a sustained return to a new normal.

**""This crosses the line because it truly invades our privacy""**

*I'm making a key assumption here: that such a device would effectively mirror the permissions and functionality of the TraceTogether app. It's the closest real-world analogue of what the government has put out for contact tracing purporses, I think it's fair to use that as a benchmark since it shows a consideration over the concerns in privacy and tracking.*

Maybe it's me coming in from a tech background, but realistically, our privacy is mostly dead.  Our phones track us to such a precise degree that if someone wanted to find us, with cell tower triangulation we'd be found within a short distance.  You use wifi?  That's even more specific, down to the dozens of meters from the router you get your internet from.  

What websites do you go to?  Our ISPs have access to that information too.  Oh, but I use a VPN.  Well, maybe you do, but the vast majority of Singaporeans don't.  And there's no guarantee that it's completely shielding you away from being found (IPV6 leaks).  Also, the 20TB of traffic passed to your ISP over the past month you're pushing?  Doesn't look suspicious at all.  And that's all if your VPN suggests they don't log, even if they do.

Between physical-location tracking and the sites you go to (destination), I'm convinced that if the government wants to, it can figure it out for the vast majority of Singaporeans.  It's not a Singapore-government thing too.  The same thing is likely to happen in other countries.  What might be different is the speed in which access to such data is facilitated.

The TraceTogether app (and potentially this physical device) is open sourced, vetted by experts (I think a close analogue are doctors and physicians as it relates to understanding vaccinations), and found not to provide location information.  Its only goal is to allow the government to trace transmissions, to prevent further transmissions and to help those who have potentially gotten the virus.  How is that bad?  And if the new device is similar, what is the problem, especially if it doesn't actually track your locations?

**""Just because we're tracked more than this device would doesn't mean we should cede further ground on our privacy.""**

First, I'm not sure how many people realize they are already being tracked much more than they think, even outside of existing companies like Google or Apple.  Second, as it relates to tracking I don't consider this any more than a drop in the bucket.  It has a time-limited use for a very specific purpose, and does not transmit your location.  Considering the utility, I see this as a positive.

**""It's a slippery slope: the government can take this exercise, make it mandatory and choose to enforce further systems like this in place""**

Three thoughts here.  For one, all eyes are on the policy makers from both Singaporeans and the global community worldwide.  There's tremendous pressure to get this right not only because of its ability to save lives *and* the economy, but anyone associated with the program will get the blame if anything goes wrong.  Part of this includes making sure that privacy is greatly considered, another is that any overreach down the road will be examined greatly by both detractors and supporters alike.  The risks of putting up a complicated, mandatory system in place are high.  The risks of being blamed if anything goes wrong is higher.  If the people associated with this are willing to put up the risk, they know they suffer the consequences.  Why not give them a chance?

On top of that, we already have far-reaching, mandatory systems in place.  NS.  NRIC. CPF.  There are concerns and criticisms over their implementation, but on balance I'd suggest that most people understand their purposes and have been okay with trading in some freedoms to fulfill the objectives they were created to serve.  It feels strange that it has to be *this* one that people feel is an overreach before details are passed out, especially if the purpose is clear and likely time-limited.  If you don't think it'll be time-limited that's fine, but I can tell you if that's what happens I'll be right beside you pressuring politicians to drop it.

Finally, let's say that the program is somewhat successful.  It's on par with where things are today: many people are frustrated, but understand the good intentions and good has been done.  There's potential considerations for a different program that's either mandatory or pretty much close to it, with similarities on this one, but for another cause.  Why immediately block the possibility of it happening, or antagonizing the process so much so early on?  If we've found that our civil servants have done a good job, why sabotage such potential programs?  Have they not earned some trust to implement further systems meant to help all of us?

**""The government hasn't handled the situation well, how can we trust them to do this correctly?""**

There's a balance here.  Things haven't been perfect, but I believe good things are being done, certainly as they relate to how many other countries have been reacting.  I continue to trust that our civil servants and politicians are doing what they think is best, and mistakes in this unprecedented circumstances are understandable.  In short, I don't think the disagreement of how some of the execution has occurred should wipe out the trust people have in what we've collectively achieved so far.

**""Third parties could do something malicious with these devices""**

I'll make this short and say that it's likely that I don't have the imagination to see what extremely nefarious things can be achieved with this, given that the core information belongs and is withheld by the government.  Also, I would suggest that anyone with a minimal interest not to have their lives completely ruined would be fearful of attempting to co-opt a governmental system explicitly meant to help with the pandemic.  I can believe that the dire consequences of utilizing what's there beyond its given purpose would be made extremely clear.

**""It's better to sound the bells early, just to make sure any potential overreach doesn't happen.""**

I agree with that, but I don't think I'm hearing a reasonable ""sounding of the bells"".  It's closer to ""poisoning the well"" before a possibile implementation even comes to the table.  Most of us agree there isn't enough information yet.  Yet many are already condeming this as the one step too far that they would even leave the country because of it.  I'm hearing extreme positions being taken, not a more measured dialogue of concern.

**""Why doesn't the government use the Apple API now that it's been released, like Google's?""**

Trying to develop native applications for both platforms is a pain.  New APIs where things might, or might not work...?  I realize this might sound like too far flung, but as a developer, new things like this give me pause.  It takes time to get them right, even if the smartest people in the smartest companies are trying to release them, especially when it's done in a rush.  It would not surprise me to see further updates in the coming weeks over this, and depending your security and effectivess on these systems would worry me.

Beyond that, while this might seem ridiculous, not everyone has a phone or uses it all the time.  Think of the elderly (and yes I know many have easily adopted newer technologies, but I'm sure you agree it's not all of them).  What about kids?  I was talking to my wife about this, and I agree with her in preferring a specific, wearable device created for a very specific purpose that you can drop when its use is no longer required.

**""Leaks by the government around our personal information don't give me confidence that this won't happen with this approach""**

That may happen, but no more than much more sensitive information that the government or many MNCs already have on us.  This really shouldn't be the straw that manages to break the camel's back.

**""Oh, it's too bad that my device... might get lost...  suffer a fall... be somehow struck by lightning...""**

I get disagreeing with policy, but this is just...  A device like this, or many of the policies put in place, are meant to help us all collectively.  It sounds to me like someone in the U.S. declining vaccinations ""because of religious reasons"" when it is a cover for just disagreeing with the policy.  It sounds like the people choosing to meet in public despite CB, because F U I disagree and I got mine.

**""You don't know any better, you're just speculating too.""**

You're right.  But I'm also not actively sharing unfounded fears in a way that can prevent a possible, viable solution from being considered, let alone brought to the table for discussion.

What if this is the way forward?  When Singapore was seen as the hallmark of what could and should be done earlier in the year, much of it was around the efforts in and around contact tracing that's still heralded, despite where we currently stand on infections, by countries around the world.  It was effective and a good thing to be proud of.  Did you not feel pride in being in a country that such a program is actively, even today, being emulated?

And yes, things have changed.  If infections were still low, we would still be living life as we did earlier in the year.  The infections seemed under control through contact tracing and we held out longer than most countries in the world in having to go through some form of a CB.  It has and continues to benefit us, and the fact that we have so many Singaporeans and foreigners going in and out of the country shouldn't suprise us if infections stemming from other nations ultimately affects us.

If this is the next step: a (to me) minimally invasive contact tracer that ensures closer to 100% adoption for a nation of people, and allows us to open up, live life as usual, but allow the medical profession to keep people safe and prevent further spreads of the disease, then I'm for it.  It would make me feel safer, and know that if I or any of my friends/family might've possibly been infected, that we get any necessary help or support right away.

But it might not happen or be possible if our echo chambers are filled with fear reinforced with more fear.  I started by suggesting that I'm proud of our fellow countryfolk for generally being pragmatic.  Being human, we are swayed by emotion, but here we ultimately decide with logic, reasoning and science.  Let us use this lens to objectively look at what may come, listen to the experts (tech or otherwise) about the invasiveness of such a device as more details come to us, and then let our civil servants know our concerns that are based on facts and information.

hp2lwc,1594435878,hp2lwc,16,,"I think these few days will be a moment of reflection on both sides, to figure out what work or didnt for their parties.

In my opinion, i think it didnt work when PAP uproots their existing MPs and airdrop them into new constituency. Meanwhile, WP continues to stay rooted and grow in existing areas. PAP would do well with such an outdated tactic, as the results are diminishing over time.

Also, the oppositions, specifically WP and PSP, has fielded really good candidates that rational voters are able to consider for this time round. Rather than some of the clowns that dilute the oppositions' standards, people like Jamus Lim brings hope that oppositions are able to hold their own against PAP. Especially since there are alot of new faces on boths sides, which goes to show that not everyone buys into voting for PAP candidates just because they are PAP.

I think the election was called at a rather bad timing for PAP, with the resentment over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic still fresh in voters minds. Coupled with issue such as the Reserved Presidency and POFMA, I think PAP has to realize that voters especially young voters do not like heavy-handed policies. 

I think social media has become an important battleground, where the opinions of the people are evident. Without taking into account the algorithm biases that control what appears on people's feed, i think it can be seen that the general public are not satisfied with PAP's performances in the past 5 years. However, it cant be said for certain if the voters are so upset with PAP, that they desires a change in the ruling party, or are they seeking for more representations of their voices in parliament.",,What went right and wrong during this elections?,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hp2lwc/what_went_right_and_wrong_during_this_elections/

I'm 16M and I've thought about making this post for a long time because I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post on but I'm not looking for friends that live overseas. Anyways, a short intro, yes I'm taking my O levels this year I love cooking a lot, and in case you haven't gotten it yet, I'm hoping to make some new friends through this post so keep scrolling if this ain't for you.

But if it is, great! I'm hoping to make some friends between 15-16years old as I've lost most of my friends and I'm having a really hard time coping with being lonely and the stress of O's right around the corner on top of the current COVID19 situation. It doesn't matter what gender you are, school, stream or race, I'm just looking people who are like me and are trying to get out of this pit of depression and loneliness which I'm sure many others experience too. 
Nowadays since I can't go out, I play games on my phone and PC, namely CSGO and PUBG mobile, feel free to pm me and we could exchange our Insta, chat and play, and maybe if all goes well, we could meet up and hang out! I'm tired of always listening to others while keeping my little emotions and feelings to myself and taking on life challenges alone, not to mention playing team games on my own. 
So yeah, there's that and just as a disclaimer, I'm sorry if this sounds discriminating, but I'm not into people who YP's and people along those lines, nothing against them but I'm picking my friends even though I'm kind of desperate.  

Yeap that's it, so pm me, we could have a chat, instagram, and maybe discord if you're into the same games! I'm not sure how far this would take me, but this is my last effort to try to give myself a chance to live.

As such, I hope those who do not deem this post fit to be in this sub, do pm me and let me know the correct sub to post this in instead of reporting it straight away.

I found it weird that there's a page where you can check your status, but can't retrieve any approval letters if the application is approved. Since we didn't receive any confirmation email, we don't have a PCA application number either.

We tried emailing them for help but they just kept sending stock replies like ""please check your junk folder"" and stuff without reading, it's really frustrating. Calling the bigger departments like MTI and ICA were of no use either, they just said it's not their responsibility.

Wanted to use a throwaway but no choice because of sub rules. 
Long story ahead:

LL: landlord
TA: tenancy agreement

My partner and I found a rental apartment - went down for first viewing, all seems good. We were looking to upgrade to bigger space and hence decided to put down the safety deposit.

Closer to handover date, we were not given the keys prior to allow us time to move in. Hence I contacted LL's agent to meet us earlier to sign TA and collect keys. Agent met us at the apartment, we checked the place and found condensation issues at bottom cabinet where the kitchen sink is located. The cabinet has an exposed concrete wall and has a musty smell - we also saw a heap of dirt (later on found to be roach droppings) between concrete wall and the cabinet. In the bedroom we saw some insect droppings too - at this point agent assured us that this place has not been inhabited for 1-2 months and that LL will fix these issues to ensure it's inhabitable.

We signed the TA in good faith and documented photographs and videos, sent them to agent for him to relate to LL, so that they can get all these fixed before we move in to stay.

That same night my partner and I decided to move some items into the apartment - when we found cockroaches (both adult and young) in the place. Now we realized that the droppings we saw earlier were cockroach droppings and that this place is infested with cockroaches. Again, we took lots of photographs and videos, sent them to agent. He responded saying will inform LL.

During the back and forth conversation with agent, he mentioned that according to the LL: the musty smell from cabinet is due to no ventilation as this place has been uninhabited, condensation is due to the air con usage, cockroach issue was because LL left the toilet trapping open for 3 days, and that there was no infestation issue when previous tenant stayed. (all of which i disagreed to - especially telling me LL did not experience infestation at all so far- I have not even moved in, surely this isn't caused by me?)

In the meantime, I told agent that there is definitely infestation and would need to postpone the move-in date 2 weeks from now to accommodate the extermination process. Initially he agreed in our text conversation and said that LL will bring in her own pest control guy - we were closing in to our move-in date and so they were to investigate on that day itself. Upon hearing this I had a bad feeling that they will conclude as ""no infestation"". True enough, that was what happened. Agent returned to me with an official invoice saying no infestation and that move-in date is to be as agreed in contract. However, although they concluded no infestation, there were some treatment done such as spraying, baiting and trapping.

As for the exposed concrete wall where cabinet is, agent says LL will fix them however her workers are unable to work now due to covid. I insisted that I'm uncomfortable living there as that is where the roaches are breeding and overall is extremely unsanitary especially since it's in the kitchen cabinet. I also asked for a date to be given to me as to when it can be fixed - agent says he cannot give me an answer. He also said that he will personally pay for a handyman with permission from LL if we are not comfortable to stay in until LL's workers can fix.

2 days after treatment is done, we went back to see some dead roaches (both adult and young) in the place. LL's pest control guy is to come back a week after to monitor.

As of now, we are extremely disappointed and feeling like both the agent and LL are cornering us to move in despite these conditions that are deemed uninhabitable. Till date we have not moved in, and am wondering what our options are. We have already paid both security deposit and 1 month advanced rental.

We know that we should have included these repairs in the written contract to protect ourselves -however as of now, TA has been signed and can only look at the next best option.

Any help will be appreciated.

They all want to be your Voice in parliament to challenge the government, but they don't want to be the government.

That is, they want to challenge the government (which, by this rhetoric and their alliances, is the PAP).

I've not heard a single one of the propose an idea or solution from them to steer Singapore through this COVID19 situation. Instead, in a time when investment revenue, and all other forms of revenue from taxes will decline due to the worldwide economic downturn, the opposition is demanding more spending, and even *lower* taxes, or abolish them completely. 

And all that stems from ideas and policies planned, which were all thought-up pre-covid. and much of those were also dead horses flogged again, and again, even after proven that they can't be done.

the Pandemic is going to rage around  the world for at least a few more years, and after which, another few years or a decade for the nations to recover.  

Singapore relies a lot on the global economy for trade and industry, if you haven't already thought about it. That means as the world suffers, we need experienced people at the helm who can direct this endeavor. 

The current government has already proven that in this crisis, that our national stockpiles are enough, that there is a reason why we don't dip into the reserves on a whim, and that we do indeed have a capable government to handle this pandemic and crisis. a government that has been praised for years for its success and even recently for handling the [current pandemic](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/gia/article/singapore-earns-high-praise-for-covid-19-response). Just google, you'll find praises sung by most countries. Think about what kind of signals Singapore would send to investors, if the model of 

Back to the opposition parties. they only want to speak up, but they don't want to be the ones who have to run the show, because they expect that the PAP will still be there to run the country while they raise issues and bring forth ideas in Parliament. None of them have raised any of the macro issues, but raise mainly micro ones that affect only certain segments of the population, and not how to move forward as one Singapore.

So the question is one that you need to ***ask yourself***: are you going to vote for a party that has been tried and tested in government and who thinks not just within the borders but also beyond them, and that we know can bring us through this pandemic, or are you going to vote for a party that only wants to criticize, debate and talk in parliament about issues within our borders, while others do the work for them.

Moreover, think macro, and not just internally: i.e how this affects us globally. The candidates that you vote for, will also determine whether our economy survives, or die.

I'll leave you with a picture of exactly what the opposition envisions themselves doing (backseat driving and claiming credit for it), while the PAP and the government machinery does all the work.

ioqs02,1599558733,ioqs02,17,,"Before I start on anything, I'd just like to thank god and my blessings that I saw while searching about BioGlobe and saw Reddit threads and other reviews online that warned me on this company's job listings and luckily I didn't fall for their MLM traps. I was sceptical with the employer before searching but still, I was lucky to come across others' opinions and reviews. Anyways, I'm risking myself because I don't think I should be sharing this but I'll do it anyway.

Don't @ me for falling for this because I believe most kids and teens like myself would just want to get easy money and work as little as possible. So don't flame my ass for being gullible haha :)  
Really, all I wanted to do was find a job for this semester break as I'm a poly student. So, I just went down to various sites(Jobstreet, Indeed) but I came across a job offer on a Telegram group as well. I regret applying for this job, turns out to be just a waste of my time. I talked to the guy on Whatsapp, and he asked for an introduction video from me(which I actually took it seriously...) and once he was happy with what he saw, he scheduled an interview/briefing with me. Told me it'd take about 1.5 hours, which I'm still in the interview while typing this out. Prior to all this, even before I sent him my introduction video, asked him on Whatsapp about the company's name and organisation type, what job scope I was meant to take on but then he totally ignored my question until he scheduled the interview. Only before the interview, he let me in on all the questions I've been asking. ""Our company is BioGlobe."" ""Coordination of appointments, assisting demonstrations of samples."" Well, that was only a quarter of the cake of the responsibilities / job scope that was actually involved. 

Below was the message/job shoutout on the telegram group.

What follows is an online Zoom interview / briefing where I was only just told about how much I can earn, how much I should work, how much I can progress throughout my 'career' with them even without any relevant work or study experiences. I wanted to understand more about the brand or what I'm working with LOL. Ended up with stuff like ""So even if you work 7 days a week and find one interested customer, you still earn $550."" Wah. No cap I can earn $550 when your water purifier costs like  $3288++... Mattress also can cost $2450+. I can see why I could earn $550 per sale. But once he said ""You know how marketing platforms they use to refer a friend and earn promo? You can use that and work with that too with your friends to sell our products!"" I won't sell my friends products like that ah, you yourself say tap water safe to drink, I buy for my friend PURIFIED bottled water la ok, $1+ only.  

Like literally, throughout the 1.5-hour Zoom call, I can safely say only 10 minutes were spent on sharing on how the products are meant to be used and what the brand advocates. The rest was explaining to me the ""GOLDEN LADDER TO SUCCESS"" and how the pay works. He also then kept sharing on the business model they had for employees and also his role in the company, their achievements blah blah blah and his achievements in the company, where he then showed me a poorly designed certificate of his ""Business Manager"" role in the company. So if you don't want to read the next paragraph where I explain how the pay works, simply put, you get consumers to use their products then you can earn money (which isn't all that bad but really la who will spend $3-4k on water purifier and 3k on mattresses especially in this pandemic?!). Next, I get that you obviously won't want to pay your ""associates"" if they don't perform well, as I would also. In that case, I wouldn't even resort to using MLM, but really just having a proper marketing model and hire professional marketers and not people who have no experience whatsoever just to lure them to get people they know to buy these products.   


To fully explain their employee working model, it was Business Builders &gt; Business Associates &gt; Business Executives &gt; Senior Business Executives &gt; Business Managers &gt; Business Division Managers.  
He then shared that anyone can become a business division manager even if they didn't have any experience prior, It's just how hard the person wants to work. And it was simply quite easy to climb the ladder. You only needed 40 sales to reach Business manager if I recall correctly. It's just utter fraudulence, I like how their website showcases the number of consumers that buy their products as well. It's just sad that they only have 4 digits as sales. You can say that your products are designed well and all already, but no one will buy them even if your company has ""SME500"" on there, due to the sheer price they cost. Further down the interview, he also mentioned how as a business division manager, you can earn 4% of what the company earns....... wow... so tempting.... if yall are able to sell 50 water purifier, you can earn like what? $6k? Wow, that's actually a lot sia. There was more about the points thingy but I won't' go into detail. I think I've said enough. But yeah, that was really about it and he just continued blabbering on with profit margins and achievements of the company, could never really understand why they even put up a job offering for people in the first place. Then he showed me his personal certificates from the company, but really, they were just budget and low medals for the best working employee there. I don't mean to flame them or say they're a bad company, but I'm just saying things that I saw with my eyes. 

Lastly, before the meeting ended, he was asking me whether I wanted to go for a training with them to experience their products and see for myself whether what he says is true and then I'd have a better idea of how to sell their products. Nah, I think I'll stick with what the majority online says about your company and how you guys conduct your marketing. He is so persistent tho, reminding me that there are 'limited slots' on the job list... sorry. I'll leave my slot vacant, but I hope no one takes it. 

Anyways, sorry for this longgggg ass storyline. Just wanted to come out and talk about this company to help or prevent anyone else from getting stuck in their trap and for legal reasons can't do anything about it or something (I don't know cause I'm not gonna join their superior job scope) and yeah.

j9jxdz,1602475344,j9jxdz,17,,"Even when flying was still an everyday occurrence, there was something special about approaching Singapore. The view from a window seat was unmistakable: tankers and cargo ships dotting the emerald surface of our waters. A sign of life, a reassurance that all was well with the economy. And then the cab ride, if you lived in town (or had to run straight to business there), from the airport, past East Coast Park to your left, through Marina Bay and into the reassuring embrace of the CBD as the familiar spine of skyscrapers (even after it was marred by that floral monstrosity topping CapitaGreen) etched our economic hopes against the skyline. Changi to the city, by air and ECP, is always the “Welcome home” promised by the SQ stewardess upon touchdown.

Last night I had the opportunity to come back to Singapore by sea. We sailed from the South China Sea, past Pedra Branca (counting the ten seconds between each flash from the Horsburgh Lighthouse), and hugged the coastline from the eastern end of Singapore all the way to the west. I saw the same journey from airport to city centre, but from a distance. And it was the first time I realised the magnitude of the improbability of it all. How remarkably *tiny* the city was. How fragile and vulnerable and temporary it could all be, if we weren’t a little more careful with it. It was night, and the lights coiled and spiralled and twinkled, bravely perhaps, but at the mercy of a finger on a switch. The skyscrapers lined themselves up, but if the sea had any ambition, it would not be difficult to knock them all down. This was a city built on the back of defiance, with little to stand on. Cast adrift, it should not have lasted five years, let alone fifty. We have an idea what willed it into existence, but it would be safe to question the intensity and integrity of this resolve, so easily forgotten, and in the stupor of our success, taken for granted. Perhaps we needed a pandemic to shake us out of our daze. We paused in silence to drink in the lights, occasionally obscured by the passing hulk of a tanker or Taobao-bearing freighter. And then we pulled away towards Tuas, and watched the lights break up and the city scatter, and it was both marvellous and frightening, to understand that we are merely a dot after all, and a dot must work much harder and brave much rougher, to simply survive, and not be erased like a blip on the radar of history.",,Singapore by sea,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j9jxdz/singapore_by_sea/

My parents and grandparents are still receiving and (unfortunately) forwarding whatsapp messages that warn of burglars acting as those handing out face masks, or that drinking a glass of hot water will help to kill the virus, etc. The problem is that when these pieces of misinformation are spread via messaging apps, the point of spread quickly becomes decentralized, since each new reader becomes another potential spreader. Although POFMA might work in cases of social media like Facebook and editorial websites, where removing or correcting the main article results in the correction of all previous shares of the post in question, POFMA, I think, is largely incapable of dealing with the quantity, as well as the decentralised nature, of forwarded messages. There simply isn't the manpower to identify and trace every one of these messages, and the fact that these are spread via closed channels of communication makes the job close to impossible.

I'm not speaking from any point of expertise, but I feel like the way an anti-fake news policy might better work is to instead focus on stopping propagation rather than trying to eliminate and correct these sources individually. For example, after the 2018 Whatsapp lynchings in India, Whatsapp put a limit to how many people/groups you can forward a message to five (previously you could forward a message to 250 groups) and removed the quick forward option. The idea is that this will help to slow down or stop the spread of misinformation by making its spread more inconvenient for the user before too many people get it and continue to spread it. Now obviously this doesn't seem to be enough for the case of the coronavirus, but the general idea is sound. If we can't police every single message (even if some of them are obviously false, and some even dangerous), prevent it from spreading too widely by making it very inconvenient for spreaders to do so. Here are some suggestions from someone who doesn't really know too much about this. All these measures require messaging companies to adopt certain measures into their software, but I don't think any (other than 5) are too difficult to implement technically speaking. 

1. Prevent the forwarding of messages by users to groups.
2. Set a daily limit on the number of messages a single user can forward.
3. Further reduce the max number of recipients an individual can forward to each time.
4. Disable the forward button by default, and make it only enableable through settings. 
5. Set a 'kill timer' on a message when it gets forwarded, such that it cannot be forwarded after a certain number of forwards.",,The inadequacy of POFMA in handling coronavirus fake news,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fvhvmv/the_inadequacy_of_pofma_in_handling_coronavirus/
fvu0fq,1586156599,fvu0fq,18,,"Hi people. I'm writing this here as I'm concerned for a friend. He's working for a large retail store (name shall not be mentioned) as a customer service officer, full operational and usually face-to-face with customers over the counter. Due to COVID-19, the store has to close as it's not part of essential service. After PM Lee's announcement on Friday, the company itself on the same day has put out an official statement for the co-workers, that they will still be paid full salary during the circuit breaker period and that everyone will WFH. My friend's department will be given an 'assignment' to do at home instead. At least that's what they were told at first.

Yesterday, my friend said that the department's manager announced due to their e-Commerce still operating, meaning they're still accepting online orders from customers, instead of WFH, they must come to work back-end in the store for 2 consecutive days, and then given OFF for 2 days subsequently. This will continue for the whole month (might extend if the circuit breaker is extended too). The store's HR also claimed they have been given permission by the government on this, that they are allowed to still come to work to settle the online order. This is contrary to what Lawrence Wong said yesterday, that ""if your business is not in the list of essential services, you either have to telecommute 100%, or stop work altogether"". My friend and his colleagues were also told to wear 'civilian' to work, meaning they should not wear their usual store uniform at work and on the way to work. This part makes me doubt whether they really did obtain permission from government to continue operating back-end. Meanwhile, the company's office staffs are all put on WFH.

My question is, is this practice normal or am I just thinking too much? Should I report this practice and if I should, where can I report this to?

gsl67v,1590723205,gsl67v,18,,"Hi All,

As part of my work I had to peruse Shan’s Parliamentary speeches to understand the new COVID laws, and in the process found something that got me thinking abit which I wanted to just share for everyone to think about, and finally found some time to write this (and therefore topic abit dated). 

On an ancillary note, this exercise really makes the case for parliamentary debates to be more accessible to the public (and for increased standards of political reporting tbh)

Anyway, as some would know by now, the new COVID Act, in Shan’s words, is one which intended to “stanch the flow of blood” to ensure that not everybody collapses from strict insistence on contractual obligations. The effect of the law is to suspend performance, i.e. payment of rents, etc, for particular contracts. 

One of them being commercial leases. If a tenant can demonstrate that COVID-19 affected business so badly that they cannot pay rent, then the tenants may defer payment for a while after using the procedures of the law (putting things in very general terms).

Now the interesting thing is that there was abit of posturing and lobbying on this particular issue in relation to landlords and tenants in Parliament. There were a significant number of MPs who raised concerns from landlords (i.e. lobbied for landlords). There were some in favour of tenants, but on the overall you can sense Shan’s annoyance when he said this in response:

&gt;Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Chong Kee Hiong all spoke about landlords, especially the smaller landlords who may require rent proceeds to service other obligations, such as mortgage payments. Mr Saktiandi also spoke about landlords who are REITs, and Mr Chong Kee Hiong as well, and the eventual impact that non-payment of rent would have on retail investors.

&gt;Sir, on REITs and landlords, I have spoken in extenso earlier. The Bill does not alter the payment obligations of the tenants to the landlords. The landlords can show the Assessors that the tenant, in fact, has the financial capacity to pay a part, if not all, of the rent. If the Assessor finds that the tenant is able to pay all or part of the rent, he may determine that the tenant pays that part or in full either immediately or after the expiry of a prescribed period.

&gt;Now, how do we balance the interests of the landlords and the tenants? Mr Chong Kee Hiong pointed out that the rate of return will be affected. I spoke at some length about rates of return. I think, at this point, the real question is not the rates of return but how do we protect the parties. Even if we do not have this Bill, the rates of return are going to be impacted. How many tenants are going to be able to pay? How many tenants are not going to be able to pay? And when a tenant is not able to pay, you put him into bankruptcy, you put him into liquidation, are there a queue of tenants waiting to come in? Is it not going to affect the bottom line anyway?

&gt;Essentially, the relief is provided for tenants who are not going to be able to pay anyway. So, all these consequences that one sets out – oh, you know, this is going to impact on the rate of return, it is going to impact on the cash flow of the landlords and so on – but we are dealing with tenants who are not going to pay you, who are not able to pay you. 

The Parliamentary Debates are worth a read for yourself to decide ([part 1](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=bill-442), [part 2](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=bill-445), [part 3](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=bill-443), [part 4](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=bill-444)), and I listed my own categorisation of the MP’s lobbied positions below for your convenience (and note just because they lobbied landlord’s concerns doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing- question is if it’s fair):

Jessica Tan (East Coast)

**Neutral Treatment**

**In support of tenants**

Louis Ng (Nee Soon) 
&gt;“I understand that landlords are not exempt from the effects of the pandemic. However, some are more financially capable of weathering the crisis than others, and measures are required to ensure that economic impact is equally distributed. Rent abatement measures, if necessary, can be calibrated. It can be targeted at larger landlords who are in a better position to shoulder some of the economic losses and smaller tenants who have greater need for such relief.”

My parents marriage haven't been smooth sailing from the start and I don't even know whether they love each other, tbh (was arranged marriage,20 plus yrs ago) so they always never talked and my dad spends more time talking to his sister on the phone whether its coming home or at home.at home they are frequented with arguments and I personally am not fond of my dad. He has no communication skills, always embarrassing me and if I say smtg that he cld improve on he will blast at me at how he's providing for me and im complaining like unthankful bastard.

Ironic that this is happening on the day it shldnt, always felt I was missing out on so many things as a family. We never had a family holiday since 2013, only showing our dynamic as a family.

And then theres my mum with bullshit everyday which has no scientific evidience (like arguments everyday over things I did. This is one example(no I am not giving an extreme example of things that she said, because then I'm lying here.) Once, she said that walking by the bin will get u the coronavirus, because I walked past by a bin (the large one) otw to the MRT because that way Is a faster way to go to the MRT. This has happened so many times over past 4 years with all the bs I get put on my plate,dk where the fake news is even coming from.

I feel like I hit my breaking point already, rn, I just wanna go and do well for As next yr hopefully, I rather be in Tekong than live at home (fuck me the library's not open yet) then rent a room and earn money on the side and live alone.

I love being alone , like rn I left my room and put my table in the varanda. All I can say is shits hit the roof on my end. And I guess I need someone to talk to

So my father passed away recently. In his CPF nomination, he listed his new wife (foreigner) for the majority of the funds and the rest to his three children. As children, we are contesting for such a sum to be given out to the wife on the grounds that we have evidence that he was involved in a sham marriage. I understand that CPF will readily provide the funds to anyone that has their name in the nomination.

But now, CPF has sent out letters to me stating they require a formalized local marriage certificate as the marriage was done in Indonesia (Indonesian marriage certificate) as it was never formalized locally nor in front of an official at the Singapore embassy in Indonesia. CPF is sending me letters as I am the next of kin and the wife is currently in Indonesia unable to visit Singapore due to the COVID travel ban.

I have not responded to CPF nor contacted a law firm to hear my case out, but I hope the Reddit community would be able to advise me on this episode.

The question is, what is the likelihood that I and my siblings could reverse the decision of the deceased and prevent the funds from being transferred over to her?

Can the foreign wife simply walk into the CPF branch and demand the money withdrawn even without the local marriage certificate?

Does it sound like a huge battle if I bring in a lawyer into the picture?

Obviously I could've gone to CPF for answers, but maybe the people here can advise me on this matter and maybe share ways on how to proceed with this.

Today was the 2nd day the park reopened for visitors with all the safe distancing measures in place. Therefore they allowed only 25% of their usual capacity. The first change noticable was that you need to register in advance via an online form with a valid ticket of season pass. Once accepted, you get a confirmation email which you need to show at the entrance.

Once you entered the park its considerably more quiet obviously. The park is open from 2 to 9pm (I didnt found that on the website, so I was very early there already), but good they open later at night, as they used to close earlier before. Some of the smaller attractions are closed and all the shows are not in operation. But most of the attractions are open.

There are quite a lot of Safe Distancing Ambassadors walking around. Every attraction has one to spread out the queue. Theres at least 3 meters between visitors in queues. Also the attractions have spaced out seating arrangements.

Because theres less people in the attractions, the waiting time can also take a lot longer than usual, even with 25% park capacity.

hkewgn,1593761979,hkewgn,18,,"Jamus Lim brought up the point of our international success in testing and the focus on outcomes not translating to opportunities for our graduates. (There was another point on the lack of strong privately-owned, local corporations to drive economic growth as it’s not relevant here, I feel) My argument here is that we have not achieved such outcomes in the first place.

On opportunities. He mentioned that our graduates are choosing jobs with little to no future or have bad trajectories.  However, aren’t wages determined largely by supply and demand? Demand is short term and not within our control (especially in the current context of Covid-19 and our small size and in the context of our education system). Having a strong supply of labour is multi-factorial but generally there is an ability to generate profits or surplus value, a deficiency of such ability in general population and efficiency in such aspects. Supply is something we have control over through education and vocational instruction and is the key to said opportunities.

But what is the reason for this mismatch in expected and actual outcomes? I feel that the reality is our university education is not producing graduates of the highest caliber. Yes our school system is one of the best performing in the world by taking the averages of testing. But averages are a low bar in the first place. How can our universities ever be considered world class and produce the highest quality of graduates when it is meant to cater to large swathes of Singapore society? If our graduates are taking on jobs that don’t require degrees or pay less then doesn’t that say something about our existing supply chain? How can a top 10 university accept students who struggled at A Levels scoring a B to C average when this phenomenon is something not observed at the likes to non-HYPC Ivies, British schools like LSE, UCL, KCL and Imperial and the UC schools, etc (Schools in the cut below Oxbridge and HYPC)?  These are schools with international recognition and are largely lower ranked than NUS (because we game the system). Heck in spite of our best efforts, at the highest levels of economic competition and innovation, we still lag behind the biggest OECD countries. We end up having an inflated amount of graduates, many who don’t deserve to be there but got there by virtue of the system’s charity and a shortcut through JC. 

What is the consequence of this? This is the reality of equality, of artificial means of upward mobility. A dilution of the higher education circle and as a result, the income pool graduates can tap into. Mobility isn’t a thing of the past but the road of ‘study hard and get degree’ trodden by previous generations has to be erased. 

Yes we may exacerbate the concentration of wealth but isn’t your ability to contribute to the economy hierarchical? The sum of graft and talent any individual possesses is capped so the maximum economic value he possesses is similarly capped. Not everyone is destined to do well in life. Why do we lap up the rags to riches stories of PAP’s MPs like CCS but treat underdog stories in the sports and arts world with such derision? Are the probabilities of stratospheric success in the former scenario infinitely more favourable than the latter? 

People say the stakes are never higher in the rat race, our education is a pressure cooker but the world isn’t kind to us. Competition between countries is increasing but it seems we are scaling back, resting on our laurels instead of aggressively discriminating based on merit and talent. Let those who fail in this aspect, find alternative paths be it through trades, entrepreneurship, etc. But don’t sell people false hopes and dreams and don’t promote degrees for the sake of it.",,"With education and meritocracy central themes during this GE, what is the problem with our education system?

hlhmn5,1593928271,hlhmn5,18,,"All views are my own. And all statements are opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

The dynamics in this election is rather different from those of the past. Aside from the changes caused by the covid-19 situation, the campaign by the incumbent seemingly dismisses the need for opposition support since “there will be at least 12 opposition MPs, more than there are now.”. This references the constitution amendments made in 2016, allowing NCMPs to now have the same rights as other elected MPs. This includes rights to vote on constitutional matters and money bills. The party line has been repeated by no less than prospective members of parliament Indranee Rajah, Lee Hsien Loong, Teo Chee Hean, Chan Chun Sing and retiring Mr Goh Chok Tong.

This left me puzzled. Who gets to be an NCMP? What can he do? Should I care?

**Who are NCMPs?**

At first glance, one might think “oh golly, what a dumb question, isn’t it common knowledge that the ‘best 12 losers’ get to be an NCMP?”. Unsurprisingly, the answer is no. It is not that simple. 

Firstly, aside from being the ‘best loser’, the prospective member has to garner no less than 15% of the votes in the constituency he ran in. This highlights that giving the incumbent a “strong mandate” doesn’t guarantee “opposition voices in the house”. 

Secondly, this rule only kicks in when there are less than 12 (elected) members of parliament not belonging to the party forming the government. 

But of course, getting into the house is just the first step. What can NCMPs do once they are selected? 

**Can an NCMP represent me?** 

Dr Teo sums up this up perfectly, “there will be at least 21 alternative voices in parliament”. Voices. 

The NCMPs will be able to speak up for you and represent views – aside from the incumbent’s – in parliament. But in no way will NCMPs be able to affect policy.

It seems to me that supporters of the NCMP scheme have forgotten to do the mathematics. With over 90 seats up for grasp, does an NCMPs vote count? To pass a bill 50% of the votes are required, or slightly less than 60 votes. To change the constitution, 66% of the votes (less NMPs) are required or about 70 votes. Turns out, the changes made to the constitution in 2016 didn't grant any real powers to NCMPs. 

Whenever the NCMP scheme is in effect, NCMPs – and the opposition, for that matter – are simply dogs with lots of bark and no ability to bite. 

What is left unsaid is: NCMPs are ineffectively representing no one. 

**What does it mean for me?** 

The truth of the matter is the NCMP scheme does matter. Otherwise, founding Mr Lee would not have allowed the scheme to pass in the house. Otherwise, the current Mr Lee would not have allowed the scheme to have increased in scope. Otherwise, the opposition would have denounced and rejected the seats when offered to them. 

**Why it matters for the incumbent.**

As the late Mr Lee famously said (and is often misquoted), “Without the opposition members, the younger team has no sparring partners. They need real sparring partners to keep fit and agile.”. Having alternate voices in parliament does matter, it ensures that a third party evaluates the proposals made by the government of the day. It also ensures that ministers, when representing Singapore at the international stage, have had practice defending our policies, our country. 

**Why it matters for the opposition.**

Despite their criticisms of this scheme, it too gives them a chance to spar against the government, testing their policy suggestions. However, the benefit for the opposition goes much further. 

Having representation in parliament gives them the opportunity and outlet to air their views and alternate suggestions at a national stage, think of it as a marketing tactic for the news general election. It also lends them credibility, we – the people, are given the opportunity to observe and rate their (potential) performance in parliament before we decide to give them a chance at representing us. 

Look at the Workers’ Party’s field today, Ms Lim was once an NCMP, as were Mr Giam, Mr Yee, Mr Tan and Mr Perera. The only NCMP who has not returned to run as a candidate is Professor Goh, citing health reasons. We know their names, their faces and their positions because they have been given a platform to make their presence known. 

**What matters for me. And why it could matter for you.**

Firstly, do I support the NCMP scheme? No. 

Despite garnering the highest percentage of votes, this does not represent the largest number of supporters. Just take for example a losing candidate in Hougang and Potong Pasir SMCs. With 26,548 and 19,740 registered electors, 40% of Hougang voters is a much larger base than 45% of Potong Pasir voters. Is it fair that a candidate with less supporters enter parliament on the basis of the size of the constituency he chose to run in? 

Recall the 15% rule? This is probably important, as it prevents individuals who have been rejected by the public from speaking in parliament. However, the same logic should be applied to all candidates who fail to garner sufficient support from the people. Allowing candidates who have not received the largest vote share to enter parliament mocks our first past the post system. 

Secondly, would I prefer my opposition candidate to accept the NCMP role should he be offered one? Certainly! 

The NCMP role gives opposition hopefuls something to fight for. In a climate where we can almost certainly say the PAP will return to form the government, the NCMP position ensures that the opposition in Singapore does not disappear into obscurity. 

Not unlike the Workers’ Party’s buy one get one free campaign with regards to People’s Association representatives, the NCMP scheme does provide us with a buy one get one free situation. Dual representation for a single constituency in parliament, who could ask for more? 

Should you support the NCMP scheme? Well, that’s up to you. Regardless of your view, your vote counts, your vote is secret, your vote cannot be wrong. And don’t you let anyone tell you otherwise.",,The NCMP scheme and why it may (not) matter.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hlhmn5/the_ncmp_scheme_and_why_it_may_not_matter/

hly3ex,1593997518,hly3ex,18,,"I posted this a while ago, and thought this is apt to re-post given the significance of this week for Singapore's immediate and perhaps longer-term future. I've also added some fresh thoughts over my last post.

\---

Recent events have made me really think hard about the quality of governance in Singapore, particularly in the areas of transparency and accountability in governance. It has also led me to wonder about the future of government in Singapore, and whether the current system is sustainable.

The Singapore government is transparent only when it wants to be (kudos to daily covid status updates, regular press conferences, and announcements), but the operative keyphrase is ""wants to be"". We don't have freedom of information legislation, so we are kept in the dark about a lot of things. The recent fiasco about POFMA 10m population has also shown that non-information and non-transparency is politically expedient, especially when dual-wielded with the weaponized POFMA.

In terms of accountability, we have seen how PAP MPs broke social distancing rules on a walkabout with absolutely no consequences. When a  similar incident occurred in NZ, the minister was demoted publicly by  the prime minister. We have witnessed a meteoric explosion of covid cases in foreign worker dormitories, with absolutely no consequences, and even an infuriating ""but no worker himself has demanded an apology"" statement from the individual who is most responsible for it. In New Zealand, the responsible minister apologized for 2 new cases. From what I observe on social media and of friends around me, we are maddened, but also maddeningly resigned. In a democracy, the electorate should be electing politicians to serve them; in Singapore, it feels like we are powerless subjects of an all-powerful political institution who grants us limited concessions and freedoms at their pleasure. 

Even constitutional guarantees are not immutable. Our omnipotent political masters have -- just like that, with a snap of their fingers -- deprived us of the Presidential elections in 2017. They have amended the highest law of the land under the guise of minority representation for political expediency. What a coincidence that we suddenly need minority representation in the office of the president just when the PAP was at risk of an effective and legitimate check against its power. What a coincidence that every other candidate was disqualified except for PAP's nominee. And who could forget Chan Chun Sing's clairvoyance in calling ""Madam President"" months before Halimah was president? Yet the same clairvoyance did not extend to the handling of the pandemic crisis. Inconvenient superpowers and their unfortunate timings, am I right?

Yesterday, Raeesah Khan was the subject of a police investigation over 2-year-old tweets for calling out in good faith what she perceived to be social injustices. I have no doubt that her tweets were written in good faith with the best of intentions. I think her track record speaks for itself. It blows the mind that this is conceivably illegal, when DPM Heng and other PAP MPs have made arguably far more divisive statements with no repercussions. There's a maxim in law that ""justice must not only be done, but also seen to be done"". In this light, our justice system -- and our political system at large -- have failed, because the public perceives two sets of rules for the elite and commoners. It might not be true in fact, but it's certainly true of perception. If even privileged Chinese-majority residents think that there is a special set of laws for wealthy expats and another for citizens, the system has really failed the test of public perception.

But I have a dream for Singapore. I dream of a Singapore in the future that leads the world not just technologically and economically, but also socially and politically. A Singapore that has shed the pejorative label of ""first world country, third world citizens"". A Singapore with a robust democracy and a competitive and unbiased press. A Singapore where we are as likely to see Straits Times headlines of WP MPs slamming PAP MPs for their irresponsible positions as we are to see the other way around.

I dream of a Singapore when POFMA in its current form is shot down by a coalition of responsible opposition MPs. When the mere idea of a reserved presidency is ridiculed in headlines across major publications, and the shamed MP who mooted it forced to publicly apologize for its racist undertones. When the word ""opposition"" has faded from mainstream political usage and relegated to social studies textbook.

I dream of a Singapore where laws are passed only when a party's MPs convince other parties of their merits through robust and rigorous debates. Where ministers apologize for mistakes, regardless of whether anyone asks for an apology. Where politicians serve the people and are accountable every single day, and not once every 5 years. Where politics are transparent and accessible to both the JC student and 80-year-old retiree.

That day is not 2020, or even 2025, but I believe it'll come. Because while the mainstream media suppresses and distorts, social media exposes and liberates. POFMA censors, but the Internet never forgets. Already, I'm sensing growing discontent and a sense of injustice among the younger generation at the status quo. Nobody likes a bully, and we are witnessing Goliath with an arsenal of state apparatus at its disposal crushing the Davids in a rigged competition. Character assassinations, distorted portrayals, one-sided representation, you name it. But the Davids are not giving up, even after years or decades of persecution. And the Davids have the power of the Internet and time on their side. 

It is a fantastic dream rooted in naivete, but aren't most dreams? It is an unrealistic ideal, but should that stop us from working towards it? Zero workplace accidents, zero traffic fatalities, and zero airplane crashes are all impossibly difficult goals, but that shouldn't mean we give up on them.

* Plan to continue supporting policies that have helped SMEs : Rental waivers, Jobs Support Scheme, Enhanced Wage Credit Scheme. I feel people underestimate how effective these policies have been. Prevented kopitiam uncles &amp; aunties from going bust. Helped with SME cashflow, &amp; kept local unemployment at 3.5%.
* General approach to wage growth is “train people to acquire more skills” rather than intro-ing minimum wage.
* Still plan to increase GST to 9%. Feel abit concerned as economy was starting to lose competitiveness even before COVID.  But understand their reasoning for it. 
* Didn’t propose any significant changes to housing or CPF schemes. I was hoping for some, mainly for single buyers &amp; and topping up CPF Retirement Account to Full upon sale of house. 
* Think the main problem a lot of people have with PAP is their approach to social issues and freedom of speech. No comments on that. 

**WP** 

* Lowering BTO age to 28, I like. 
* Like the idea of removing PSLE and having 10 year through-train option for primary &amp; secondary schools. 
* Like the idea of forming EXIM Bank to finance SMEs. Idea is that we loan international buyers to purchase local products and increasing our exports. Similar banks have worked in India and USA.
* Do not like the idea of minimum wage. Economy is made up of 50% SMEs. Min wage will increase their cost and cause unemployment to rise among low wage workers like my brother. Wage increases will also be pegged to min wage. 
* Abolishing retirement age, not so sure. Significant changes would have to be made to the CPF scheme. Younger workforce may have difficulties entering labour market as older gen stays on for longer. 

**SDP**

* Also supports removal of PSLE, good. 
* Also supports minimum wage, bad. 
* Wants to remove land cost from the calculation of HDB flat values, to bring flat prices down. Mixed feelings. Removing land cost would flatten the value gradient of flats across the country. Flats would only reflect their production cost, yes. But this means flats in CBD area will cost as much as flats in Yishun. BTO flat values would not reflect proportionate demand, and this will prolly lead to dramatically high resale values in 10 years, I think.
* Wants to remove current Medisave schemes and replace it with an NHS-like system. Each citizen pays $50 per month to fund this, along with other normal taxes. Patients pay 10% of hospital bill, capped at $2000. Positive plan, but think they’re grossly under-estimating the cost, just like UK politicians. 
* Wants to reduce minister salaries. Has an interesting theory that high salaries would encourage groupthink phenomenon. Where minister would agree to everything higher-ups say because they duwanna lose their high paying jobs.  
* Wants to scrap GST for essential items, raise GST for luxury goods
* Wants to raise income tax for top 1% from 20% to 28%.
* Wants to abolish CPF minimum sum scheme, &amp; return all savings at 55. Bad idea. Don’t think most people in sg are very responsible with money.

j9qqq4,1602508788,j9qqq4,18,,"Bear with me because this is going to be a rant.

Since the beginning of COVID, offices are closed and we all have to WFH. During CB &amp; Phase 1, it's not too bad because construction / renovation etc. have been paused. We couldn't dine out anyway.

Fast forward to beginning of Phase 2 in June, dining in has resumed. Construction has resumed. For many of us who WFH, sometimes going out for work and a coffee in a café is a good way to resume normalcy. We also will go to a café when home internet outages happen, which is more common than thought.

What I'm noticing is that more and more cafés are imposing time limits to stay there. Do I disagree with it? Well, I don't. It's business survival. Us on the seat means 1 less customer to serve. However, if the place is empty on weekdays (less than half seats full), I think it's fine to stay there. Especially for heartland cafés, if this is a good place I'm sure to come back as a repeat customer (and I have. Cries in credit card bills). If the place is getting filled up and I've been there for 2 hours? I'd politely pack up and leave. No questions asked.

And yet, for some reason, probably due to 1 or 2 bad customer encounters, these are sprouting up like dengue clusters in a red zone. When I approached a service staff with the card, she said ""yeah, company policy...because when we didn't impose, a customer argued for his/her right to stay working while a queue was forming (before dinner time).

It's really sad to see this. The absence of these rules means there is an innate trust between the customer and the establishment. And once it's ruined by a few black sheep, these privileges all go away. An extra hour might mean 2 more emails done, but might mean more to students taking exams, spending half their pocket money in exchange for some hours of peace because the libraries are closed.

I hope this doesn't grow more and more...but realistically, I know it will...because of the poor decisions of a small handful of customers...and to them I say ""thanks, YOU SCREWED US ALL!""

I mean of course I'm not saying that these people all got infected recently - they could just be discovered but... this is pretty serious right?

 ”Don’t Pray Pray”...... Hope Your Children Speak Proper English!

I had a chance to listen to the condensed version of Chan Chun Sing’s recent closed-door dialogue.

The first thing I will advise is that all parents should stop their children from listening to it. It is a disgraceful glorification of Singlish, which has no place in a 1st World Country, where proper English should be taught and spoken. If our children were to speak like him in that audio, it would be the death-knell of the career prospects for many, unless you are an elite. Chan Chun Sing is really better suited to being Phua Chu Kang’s colleague if he chooses to speak in that manner!

Second, it was equally disgraceful that he chose to describe Singaporeans as “Idiots”, “Suckers” and “Disgraceful”. Many Singaporeans expressed their outrage to me about his remarks and I fully understand how they feel! From this incident, Chan Chun Sing shows himself to be cut from the same elitist cloth as his Party colleague Goh Chok Tong, who described those earning less than $500K as “mediocre”.And this from a Party that professes to be - With You, For You, For Singapore!

Chan Chun Sing should know that many Singaporeans have lost confidence in how the government is handling the crisis. We now have the highest number of infections outside of China, despite being the furthest Asian country away, apart from Indonesia. Day after day our infections are increasing when other places such as Macau have not seen an increase in 11 days. That is what led to the recent panic-buying.

And is there anything unusual for people to want to get hold of masks? As far as I am aware, SINGAPORE is the only Asian country where the government advises its citizens not to use the mask, unless you are sick. The fact is that more and more people are now aware that wearing the mask is important to prevent the spread of the disease. Even the Hong Kong Society For Infectious Diseases has advised people to wear masks at all times in public areas, regardless of whether symptoms of Covid-19 is present. It is disgraceful that for weeks now, Singaporeans have not been able to purchase adequate masks for use.

Even tried plus500 which I later learned is shady. Basically, I deposited 200 dollars and earned 30, tried to withdraw but they wouldn't let me due to my ""inexperience"" and wanted proof. 

Banks are a freaking rip off with that 25 dollar fee.

Normally I’m not that anal about wanting to whistle-blow, but some of them are people who returned from Europe and ASEAN countries right before the SHN and border bans kick in. So they returned in early March from Europe/ Australia/ Vietnam/ returned from KL and JB by car a day before the lockdown. They narrowly avoided our SHN regulations. (PS they are different groups of people in my different classes).

To make matters worse, some of them had a fever and were coughing but didn’t seek medical advice because they’re foreign students. They’re now complaining on social media about our draconian and unconstitutional laws (the new IDA regulations) and don’t seem to take this seriously. Our university gave out thermometers in late Jan/ early Feb but some of them didn’t collect it until late March when the school passed very strict sanctions on violation of temperature screening rules in school. The same people from the latter group almost didn’t declare their temperatures beforehand because they posted their temperature taking attendance rate (1-3%) online with an “oops” caption.

Now I see their social media and I’m concerned. I went to PHPC a few days ago to get my respiratory symptoms checked (no fever). Looking back, I realised my coughing started after sitting beside people who returned from Australia and Vietnam in class. They are now serving SHN which I heard is imposed by the university.

ftcw4p,1585789910,ftcw4p,20,,"I think that although there was a delay between the time China released news of the virus and the time the outbreak occured (thus no way to have stopped the first batch of tourists/returnees from Wuhan from entering SG), we could have stopped the vast majority of cases from entering Singapore by closing our borders to at least all flights from China, on the first week we received notice of the virus.

So some of you may say, that is an unreasonable course of action at the time because it was not announced as a pandemic yet, etc. so to close our borders immediately on the premise of a possibly contained virus is uncalled for. But I think that any kind of easily contact spread virus = grounds for at least immediate border closure to all flights originating from the country of the epidemic. We did not do this for MERS-CoV because MERS is difficult to transmit from person to person even with close contact, so the chances of it become a pandemic is low. But all viruses that are easily contact spread from person to person such as Covid have high potential to become pandemics. It is a cause to raise the alarm immediately. This is especially the case for Singapore because the majority of our tourists come from China and we get large numbers of Chinese tourists every day (before Covid) and therefore we are one of the most at risk communities. 

Now that we only made the decision to totally close borders two weeks ago, we take on an unnecessary increase in casualties and economic damage. Since the end outcome was total border closure anyway, the net loss for the country = present and future costs incurred due to additional influx of cases - revenue earned from keeping borders open for a few more weeks. If I do very simplistic calculations based on tourism and investment gains from 2018, the immediate loss incurred from a border closure on day 1 of receiving notice, is about 3 billion's worth in 3 weeks - far less than the 40+ billion we are setting aside for current and future measures.

Of course, there would be some more cases after border closure due to people getting infected with the first wave of tourists/returnees but not manifesting symptoms until 2 weeks later (hence possibly spreading it during this time). But I think it would be far less than the amount we currently have due to keeping borders open for another few weeks before closure, letting more infected people enter and spreading the disease. 

My opinion is that the initial low number of cases (80-100) and the slow rate of increase (several to ten a day) made us complacent of the situation, that we overlooked the possibility that it was the calm before the storm and that there were many potential cases still brewing in our midst (now showing symptoms). So now we have the second wave, which is all the people who came in before and during those few weeks when the borders were still open/ those that interacted with them.

So the conclusion is, if I were the government, I'd have taken a guaranteed few billions in economic loss over potential tens of billions, and closed the borders to at least all China incoming flights (or all flights) upon receiving notice of a easily contact spread widespread epidemic. Perhaps it would not have been ""reasonable"" then, but looking back at it from now it would have been the correct thing to do, since we ended up having to do it anyway. The short term infection figures from a virus with a long incubation time and being asymptomatic during that period are VERY misleading, and to base measures off those figures is a mistake that practically every country made and hence are facing the same pattern of a huge spike in cases. I think this is a lesson to learn about the pattern of how pandemic cases rise and we need to prepare for the correct initial response if such situations ever happen again. Our ability to control and mitigate the impact of the outbreak is definitely top class, but it would be better if we always acted to avoid the disaster before it has a chance to occur.",,"Would the correct initial response to Covid have been to initiate a full border closure immediately, rather than delay?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ftcw4p/would_the_correct_initial_response_to_covid_have/
fu3nfv,1585897366,fu3nfv,20,,"After staying at home for far too long, I went to Sri Nada to get a haircut. The shop has been around since Compass Point days, and boasted a small line of queue before the virus. So I went to try it out for myself.  


Since my hair had grown far too long and messy, I asked the barber to 'make it neat'. I understand this kind of blank cheque is asking for it, but little did I know the outcome would be FAR WORSE than any loose definition of 'neat'.  


So what went wrong? Well, I think I got unlucky to end up with the barber that doesn't really care too much about standards. 

First, the barbershop had a TV set up at the back of the shop. I get it. Barbers have downtime and what not, and the shop needs some background noise. But when I was getting my hair cut, this barber would be frequently glancing over. It wasn't like he was taking a peek whenever he finished a section or whatever (which is fine by me). HE WAS CUTTING MY HAIR WHILE HAVING HIS HEAD TURNED TO THE SIDE WATCHING THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. 

Meaning no intention whatsoever to look at what he was doing, just snip here snip there and then you're done. I wanted to tell him to idk, pay more attention to his profession, but there I was this wimpy Chinese kid in Kampong Glam, so I kind of kept my mouth shut and resigned myself to my fate.

Not all was bad. He did make this nice border on the sideburns, and took time to shave off the bits on my neck. I didn't even notice how badly he screwed my hair over because he combed my hair to the side until I got home. 

See for yourself. Look at how they massacred my curly-wirly hair.  [https://imgur.com/a/D7sS7Me](https://imgur.com/a/D7sS7Me) 

I don't mean to hate. I just want to offer my personal experience at this barber shop. 

So when you're deciding whether 12 dollars is a good price to pay to have your hair cut at Sri Nada, keep in mind that there's a chance you'll end up like someone slapped melted cream on a ping-pong ball.",,My terrible experience at Sri Nada in Compass One.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fu3nfv/my_terrible_experience_at_sri_nada_in_compass_one/

I gave her some words of encouragement but it didn't really help cos she was inconsolable.

She was really upset, and I think her sadness spilled over to a little fight we got into. We were at the supermarket buying food and she I think she hinted that she wanted me to pay for her snacks cos she was upset and needed a gift (her language of love is gifting). However, I just didn't get the hint cos I am quite blur sometimes. My decision to let her pay for her own food triggered her anger. With her stress/sadness accumulated, she became really pissed at me.

She's pissed to the point that she even blocked me and issued a break-up call (she does this when she is really upset but after a while she cools down cos she is bipolar like that sometimes). Knowing the error of my ways, I later went to the supermarket to buy some snacks and left it at her door as she lives close-by.

&gt;What contribution will they make in Parliament, adding “contrast” to the discussions, they say, if they get elected as MPs? What will happen to Singapore, if they form the government?""

This is clearly falsehood, opposition had not been silent on tackling COVID-19. 

1. Leon Perera asked if the Health Ministry is looking into testing sewage for the coronavirus as the authorities in Switzerland and Australia are doing.
2. Pritam Singh had talked about COVID-19 testing and Strait Times had reported ""*Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said, in response to Workers' Party chief (WP) Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC), that there have been several constraints on Singapore's testing capacity that prevented more widespread testing earlier on*.""
3. Chapter 1 of the WP's manifesto is ""Tackling covid-19 and thriving in a post-COVID world"".

So clearly opposition has not been ""completely silent on how to tackle COVID-19"" and the statement is falsehood. Our government's position against falsehood is loud, clear and swift as seen by the recently issued POFMAs, 10 million population and handling of COVID-19. 

So why is Mr Lee (as it a rally, he should be wearing the 'candidate hat' rather and the 'PM hat') making a false statement during his rally and where is the government's loud, clear and swift action against the falsehood?",,Opposition 'silent' on how to tackle Covid-19 is falsehood,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hmn9ig/opposition_silent_on_how_to_tackle_covid19_is/

f0sigs,1581173366,f0sigs,21,,"In light of the recent coronavirus situation and, in particular, the raising of DORSCON alert level to Orange, we are witnessing a range of reactions all over the world. In Singapore, masks, hand sanitizers, and alcohol wipes are now precious commodities. People are recoiling whenever someone sneezes or coughs. Supermarket shelves are rapidly being cleared up and plans are being cancelled. We are experiencing a lot of fear.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗗𝗼 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗼?

In modern society, numerous risks (e.g., terrorism, catastrophes, and pandemic outbreaks) lurk around every corner. Whenever people witness an emergency situation or see someone getting harmed, our brains are hardwired to react in a certain way. The amygdala of the brain (emotional system) gets activated together with regions of the cortex (cognitive system) that analyze and interpret behavior. In times of stress and uncertainty, this thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system, resulting in 𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗰 and 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿. This translates into a phenomenon more commonly known as survival mode or fight-or-flight, which is driven by the need for self-preservation, protection, and safety. Such primal instincts date back to prehistoric times, where we needed to be on the constant lookout for danger in order to survive. The same primal instincts are activated in our present-day crises. We are hyper-focusing on the virus.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗨𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆

While our brains react to keep us safe and protected, the resulting panic inadvertently leads to massive costs borne by our society. Chinese nationals or people of Chinese descent are experiencing discrimination. Tension, stress, and anxiety are at an all-time high; we worry about our health, our job security, and the larger economy. Panic buying has also led to stocks running out. Consequently, people who are sick have found themselves deprived of essential items like masks and Vitamin C.  Panic buying further breeds anxiety rather than alleviates it, creating a downward spiral of panic and anxiety. Thankfully, our Government has taken action to monitor black market sales, protecting us from the cost of inflated prices.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼 𝗪𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲?

Interestingly, while we are wired for self-preservation, research has shown that in times of crises, people are also capable of responding in prosocial ways. Last week, netizens shared accounts of people giving out free masks and hand sanitizers – a counter-intuitive move when we should be considering our self-preservation. How do we dig deep, and find in ourselves this capacity to manage our fight-or-flight responses?

𝟭. 𝗔𝗰𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘀. We are all struggling with fear, to varying degrees. Validating and acknowledging our fears, knowing that we may get triggered by each other is a first step to managing our anxieties. Name the fear and pause to consider our responses. Resource-sharing could unite rather than divide our community in this time of need.

𝟮. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿. As this would be a hot topic, be assertive with your feelings of discomfort or anxiety should this topic be too difficult for you. Also notice if this topic escalates fear and anxiety in your friends and family. Listen and respect if they prefer not to engage in this.

𝟯. 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗱𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝘂𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱.  It is not necessary to stockpile on food and other essential items as this breeds undue panic. Hoarding necessities also prevents others from attaining them, especially those who may need it more than you do. This creates huge inconvenience to others, and in turn, promotes a climate of hostility. 

𝟰. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.The virus situation would inevitably be on major headlines. Be intentional with your choice of information and entertainment rather than be consumed by inaccurate updates and precautions borne largely by fear and panic. 

𝟱. 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝘂𝗿. Being a keyboard warrior could help air your grievances. But pause to think about how this generates additional stress and tension both within your social circle and the larger society. We could seek to understand different perspectives and choices, rather than engage in the blame game.

𝟲. 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘄𝘀. Turn to reliable sources of information such as www.moh.gov.sg and gov.sg WhatsApp service (go.gov.sg/whatsapp). Fact-checking could help to ground us, especially when we feel overwhelmed with inconsistencies in the news.

First of all, the fatality rate is only low in Singapore because of the relatively low amount of cases we have (compared to China), adequate medical resources and aid can be allocated to one patient who is sick and treated with the most care. If an outbreak of 1000+ cases were to happen, our medical infrastructure will not be able to handle it  (Look at China’s makeshift “hospital camps”) Fatality rate will definitely go up. 

Also, the current 2% fatality rate in China is also highly questionable. Personally, I wouldn’t trust it completely. If China were honest from the beginning, the outbreak will be contained and controlled in the first place.

Besides that, many people forget the fact that the virus actually could actually mutate***. That’s how it started in the first place. If the virus really became something like a season flu and widespread, no one knows if it will mutate into something more deadly.

I’m in my 20s and relatively healthy. If I were to really get the virus, I probably will survive (with a scarred lungs maybe ). But I’m not sure about it for my parents who are in the 50s.

Malaysia has just announced that it will restrict all movement throughout the country from 18 March to 31 March to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 within Malaysia. 

Given the close proximity between Singapore and Malaysia, many Singaporeans may be concerned about what this will mean for them. 

The Government has been actively working with essential firms such as NTUC Fairprice, Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm International to increase our stock of food and essential supplies over the last two months. This means that we are not in danger of running out of food or other supplies brought in by our retailers. 

In addition to building up our inventory of food and essential supplies, we also have in place a robust multi-pronged strategy that will ensure we do not run out of the essentials we require. For example, we have local production capabilities for products such as noodles, infant milk powder and canned goods among others. In the event that we need to increase supply for our domestic consumption, we can ramp up quickly and easily to do so. We have also continued to diversify our sources of essential goods, for example we get a good amount of vegetables from China and even go as far as Australia and Spain to secure our supply of eggs. 

Although we are not facing any shortages, I urge everyone to continue to purchase in a responsible manner and to purchase only what you need. Otherwise, no amount of stockpiling will be sufficient. 

Businesses that employ Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily may have to activate their Business Continuity Plans. If they need assistance, they should contact our economic agencies who stand ready to assist.

We will continue to stay in touch with our Malaysian counterparts as the situation evolves. Our priority is to ensure that our people and our businesses are able to continue with their lives and their livelihoods.

I am aware that many of these new restrictions and announcements may be quite overwhelming for many people. I ask for your continued trust and support as we work hard with all stakeholders to ensure that we get through these short-term challenges together.

My opinion:

Firstly: I do not agree with them to hold early elections now but I do think what TCH had said makes some sense. 

Let's say the solutions/measurements they have for covid and incoming economy recession is highly unpopular with the people but considered necessary by them. Baring in mind that PAP did create policies that are unpopular with the people. Without mandate from the people, 4g ministers will be much more reserved in going ahead with such decisions, scared that the people give them the boot. Which will directly limit their choice of actions.

What he say just further convinced me that we are going to have some drastic measurements / policy coming our way that are going to be very unpopular. Such as prioritizing economy over  life.

Not that I agree with him but trump said it ""we cannot let the cure be worst than the problem"" I'm sure he isn't the only one with this opinion.

fvmd98,1586124127,fvmd98,21,,"The Circuit Breaker can be stressful or anxiety-inducing for some people, myself included. For myself, being out everyday isn't really a matter of choice, and in fact was encouraged by my therapist as the most ideal way to deal with my current situation (that was before the whole COVID-19 outbreak). But for now, staying home is the socially responsible thing to do.

For those in the same boat as me, here are some tips I hope can ease your stress or anxiety during this period:

1. Read up on mental health coping tips online. 

A good place to start would be the US CDC's guide on [Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html).


2. If you need to talk to someone, the Singapore Government is setting up a [dedicated Covid-19 hotline offering emotional support](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/government-to-set-up-covid-19-hotline-offering-emotional-support). 

I'll update this post with more details once the hotline is set up.


3. There are other mental health support hotlines that should be available during this period too. A list is available on [HealthHub](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/support-groups-and-others/20/call-on-these-when-you-need-help).

One very important number to note is the Samaritans of Singapore hotline at 1800-221-4444.  


4. Check out important links and things to do on the r/Singapore [COVID-19 pinned post](https://reddit.app.link/DHtf2sZMr5).  


5. At home, when dealing with abusive or toxic relationships, consider whether it would be worthwhile to fix these broken relationships or to try to avoid contact with the person as much as possible. While no one including me can make this choice for you, please do seek a mental health professional's advice before proceeding.  


6. If you have the budget, sign up for streaming services and make a list of all the shows you want to watch. Try to focus on options that will make you happy or those that help improve your life. It's also the perfect time to sign up for one-month trials of these streaming services.  

If paying for streaming services isn't an option, consider free NLB e-books &amp; magazines on [Libby/OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com) and PressReader. Of course, podcasts and YouTube are a great free way to pass time too.  


7. If you have more money, consider investing in a pair of active noise cancelling headphones because it will help you block out external noise and distractions.  


8. Go out for walks at your park or help shop for groceries and essentials. Fresh air and a change of atmosphere, no matter how short, helps in improving your mood. Do remember to practice safe distancing, wear a mask and check the apps to ensure your public park or shopping mall isn't crowded when you head out.    


9. If you really can't stay at home, especially if your safety is concerned, consider volunteer roles that help the community during this period. One option I can think of is the [SG Clean Ambassadors Network](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e7484a2ca6a010011862c59). You can also go to [SG Cares Volunteer Page](http://www.volunteer.sg) to see more volunteer roles. If you want to earn some extra cash, I think applying for roles such as food delivery rider would be of great help during this time as there would be lots of demand.

I am in Singapore using a Singaporean PayPal account and I didn't know setting up a PayPal account would hurt so much. Please, I really need your help to advise me what to do with this situation.

Just yesterday on 12th May 2020, I received five emails regarding how a chargeback case was opened. The guy is disputing an amount of $0.10 SGD which he transfered to me on 30th April 2020 for $1000 SGD. 

I don't know how to go about this, I've only used PayPal to purchase things, but never to sell things. My friend pointed out that by setting up a donation button on my Twitch stream I've labelled myself as a ""Seller"" and the donator is the ""Buyer"". The thing is, I've limited that to at least $1SGD, I don't accept donations underneath that.

I should've just refunded the $0.10 immediately when I saw it but I marked it off as my friend trolling me because I do have a friend that has spammed donations in this manner before.

You can view the images of what happened over here at http://imgur.com/a/SqFS87Y I'm lost, I don't know what else to do. I tried calling PayPal and MasterCard but their offices are down due to covid 19. And I called POSB and they told me the only thing they can do is cancel the card entirely. I have three options when I click on the ""respond"" button on the resolution center.

The first is to provide any shipping details which I don't have any since I'm not selling him a product. The second is to say that I've already issued a refund. I believe I could go to the individual transaction and refund his $0.10 as seen in this helpful [video](https://youtu.be/Py5lnwNwA9A) in which this streamer explains how to tackle chargebacks. I can then take a screenshot of each individual refund and place it as proof on the resolution center. And the third is refunding him his entire disputed amount of $1000, which I am clearly not going to do.

I've already emailed and tweeted at PayPal regarding the matter but they've yet to respond. And the more time goes by the more anxious I become. I don't want to wake up after 10 days to find out $5000 has been drained from my bank account.

I'm really not familiar with how PayPal works but I just want to understand two things, the first being if I go past the 10 days that they have given me to respond on the resolution center, will the disputed amount of $5k SGD in total go to the scammer or will the $0.50 go to the scammer? And the second being if I unlink my debit cards to PayPal right now, will this matter count as a pending payment? I.e. Will they still deduct $5k SGD from me?

""
Fortitude — this trait of courage in adversity has come to describe our early generations.

In his first National Day Rally in 1966, our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew said that our capacity to face up to situations, however unpleasant, was one of the great qualities for survival. He believed that we will progress as long as we reward initiative and resourcefulness. As long as whenever we face peril, our courage and resolve is never found wanting.

Our early generations lived up to these values. They showed fortitude as they defied the odds of survival to unite as one people, grow the economy and secure a place in the world. Each generation has its own trials and tribulations. The COVID-19 pandemic is testing nations and peoples around the world. It is also our biggest crisis since independence. Compared to our founding generation, we face this crisis from a position of strength. Our resilience as a society and our deep financial reserves are built on the sweat and toil of our founding generation, and the personal sacrifices they made for the larger good.

The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting lives and livelihoods across the world and in Singapore. I thank each of you for playing your part, and for taking the circuit breaker seriously. This has brought new community cases in Singapore down to single-digits, and we are now on course to gradually re-open our society and economy.

The battle against COVID-19 is far from over. We must continue to resource our healthcare system and frontline officers well. As we are re-opening our economy in phases, we will continue to support our viable businesses, especially those which are not able to open immediately.

Jobs will be a key part of tomorrow’s Budget. The Jobs Support Scheme has helped many employers retain their workers. But a number have lost their jobs, and some are worried that they might be retrenched. Those in your 40s and 50s are more anxious. We will help you turn anxiety into action. We will support those in their jobs to learn and upskill. We will create new jobs for those who are seeking employment. We are also creating traineeships and other opportunities for those completing their post-secondary education this year.

In addition, we will provide additional support for our social sector agencies, so that they can continue to help the vulnerable among us and better mobilise Singaporeans to contribute their time and monies as the pandemic continues.

These additional measures will require a further draw on our Past Reserves. I have briefed President Halimah Yacob on our plans and she has given her in-principle support. I thank Madam President for her support, together with the Chairman and Members of the Council of Presidential Advisers for deliberating the proposals on short notice.

The decision to use our Past Reserves has not been an easy one — we deliberated long and hard on this. Our past reserves were hard earned, and we have the responsibility of making every dollar count. I will outline the measures in Parliament tomorrow.

The battle against COVID-19 will be a long one. The road ahead will be uncertain, with more ups and downs. Our generation must have courage in adversity, to adapt and to emerge stronger, just like our founding generation. This is why I have named the upcoming budget Fortitude.

Moving forward with Fortitude — as we stay United as one people, remain Resilient in the face of adversity and stand in Solidarity with one another.

\- PLQ allows entry only by IC scan or manually, and when I was looking for a QR code, the staff at the entrance was somewhat rude and said ""we don't do QR codes here"".

\- Office Buildings -&gt; My own office building has the QR code and temperature scan, which I believe should be standard requirement.

gzdb1s,1591667033,gzdb1s,21,,"I’m writing this post feeling annoyed after looking at all the comments on ST/Today/MS articles regarding the COVID-19 Wearable.

It is SUPER CLEAR that Singaporeans are either (1) very misinformed about how the wearable works, or (2) trying to slam the government in every means they can. 

(Assuming the information released is true)
The wearable device uses Bluetooth, SIMILAR to how TraceTogether works. It only logs the data locally (on your own device) when you’re in close proximity with someone who has the device too. These records do not store location, only persons you’ve come into close proximity with. Only in the case when you’re tested POSITIVE, MOH will retrieve these records to find those you’ve been in close contact with. These records will be wiped off after 25 days. Most important of all, they’re encrypted.

What most Singaporeans are missing out on is: the device only has Bluetooth as the means of transmitting data. Data is not transferred over any data network. It’s literally impossible for the government to get your data &amp; use the wearable to trace you. The only means to get the data records is through physically obtaining the device.

hp4qmj,1594445680,hp4qmj,21,,"PAP's strategy to pull an election in a crisis didn't seemed to have pushed votes towards them, and the votes showed a shift away from them. They won with 61.24% of valid votes compared to 69.9% in 2015, and 60.14% in 2011.  Showing a good push for opposition in 2020.

PAP rushed an election in the middle of a pandemic which have not even shown signs of settling for this. So why? There are 2 folds to this.

**Offense**

This is the common argument put out there - people rushed to stability during crises as seen in 2001 - 9/11, and 2015 - LKY's death. And there is probably truth in this and past results most definitely contributed to PAP's decision to do it now. Plus, there have been 4 budgets announced with cash hand-outs, unemployment benefits doled out in mass to people. This directly will allow PAP to take advantage of their immediate actions n rush to stability to gather more votes.

**Defense**

Not looked at enough. Why do you think all opposition wants to call a GE later? Because it would be in their favour and PAP will be less favoured within the \~1 year time frame left to call a GE. It's more about the timing of COVID - an extremely difficult and long crisis on health, economic and social fronts (you can't solve this in 1 year and show your report card to voters that easily) and the limited time left for PAP to get an election.

PAP will lose further votes as this covid crisis goes on because of entrenched unemployment (if you're unemployed for 1-2 months you can accept it but if you're unemployed for 1 year, you are desperate and the anger builds up), rising import to living costs from trade problems, no miracle recovery coming from China like '08 and more and more local and global companies will go bankrupt and poorer economic opportunities for everyone overall. Calling for a GE in about a year from now will only showcase the terrible report card for SG economy, jobs and income, even worse than '08 crisis leading up to 2011 GE.

They hurt the incumbent more than the opposition because eyes are on the PAP to handle it well and not the opposition. But handling it well not only requires good policies and leadership to execute it but also requires luck, cooperation from other countries, and there are way too many factors they cannot control. I believe this is a big key point considered by PAP.

Which is why I believe PAP played this based on both offense and defense factors and thus PAP's best interest will be hold the election now. So it isn't that their plan to call a GE to get more votes for a rush to stability backfired on them hard, but that PAP didn't have much of a choice either way and they stand more to gain by putting an election now.

**Results**

But PAP's results to a lot of us was pretty big shock - the margins were very close in some and overall fell significantly. PAP votes are a report card because sinkies want PAP, so you can approximate unhappiness with votes for n against PAP. Note this is changing quickly with stronger opposition candidates, but I believe it shows more on PAP poor performance on 4G leadership, their policies bulldozer more than anything.

Goes to show how much unhappiness was on the ground and I assume a significant portion came from anger built up during the 9 days campaign online and covid response. (recency) Online, the polarity is extreme and an echo-chamber depending on where you land. You see newsworthy news, not policies news, i.e anger at Ivan Lim, RK saga etc, this drives further anger for or against depending on which camp you are on. And coinciding with very good opposition candidates, PAP lost a lot on margins this time round, I think this, they probably didn't expect. Despite some narrow wins in places like WC, a 61% of votes, and 89% control of parliament would be considered a major victory in any other countries like Taiwan. Anyone who plays any MOBA or chess knows that a win is a win, regardless of how shitty they performed in game. The only question is can they win the next game.

**Next GE**

Now with a swing towards opposition, voters on the ground will be afraid to vote any more PAP out next GE. Voters do look at past votes and performance as a gauge. Many of young adults in my circle felt that now was not a time for change the crisis and most definitely do not want PAP out and heck this election was supposed to be a big win for PAP. Political chess wise, PAP played that well but of course ultimately, what you did with your mandate as an incumbent everyone can see and that changed sentiments pretty hard this time round.

BUT, I'm sure next time round, without as much anger, they will gladly swing towards PAP big again. This goes for close battlegrounds like WC and EC. WC was solely carried by TCB (ex-PAP, to most he's more than qualified as a PAP member) but he's 80 years old now. WC will swing violently back to PAP if TCB is not contesting next GE. This is a PAP stronghold and no one in the west here wants PAP out, just demographics of people here will tell u that - elderly, foreigners turned new citizens zone.

And in 5 years, the fallout of covid would likely have been cleared out mostly, and relatively the bump in economic recovery n opportunities, from a terrible spot in 2020, over the next few years will turn to become PAP's report card to show to voters and PAP will say ""let us continue on this growth trajectory"". The timing will then become much sweeter for PAP because PAP always have the authority to call GE when they want it - delay if its not ripe, push if its ripe, PAP will once again do so at a timing favorable to them. Duh.

And this time round, there will be a larger fear of a missing PAP on the ground once again. What this means for opposition is that they need to field Jamus calibre people coupled with the strong social media victory like this round (but getting traction and viral positive videos on purpose is extremely difficult), in order to retain their %, not to mention take any more. Doing well is not just enough, opposition need to be excellent n win in political chess hard for anyone to get past the PAP buff shining over their candidates. This is not including actions taken by PAP to gerrymander, possible populist policies to gather more votes the next round.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; Expecting a base swing of few % towards PAP, i.e much harder for oppo to take any more constituencies. PAP lost popularity, but did not lose as big as people declared, they might have if the GE was held later or a longer campaign time was given. PAP will now have an upper hand next GE because it will likely not be rushed again.

1. **Case 93**: Right now MOH has not reported any links yet to this case. However, if you see in the [report here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/four-more-cases-discharged-three-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed), it mentions that the case stays at Bukit Batok Street 31 and was sick on the 17th Feb. Now, there's actually another woman who was sick early on that also stayed there on the 7th, specifically [case 36](https://www.wuhanvirus.sg/cases/case-36-38-year-old-female-singapore-permanent-resident). Case 36 got it from the grand hyatt hotel business meeting. Currently, MOH has not reported yet, but it seems to suggest that there's community spread, and case 93 might have been infected by 36, living in the same place. The website actually has a great link that groups up cases by mentions, you can see the timeline here [https://www.wuhanvirus.sg/places/bukit-batok-street-31](https://www.wuhanvirus.sg/places/bukit-batok-street-31)
2. **Case 92**: Again MOH has not reported links to this case yet. He lives at Serangoon Avenue 3 and if you see the website [https://www.wuhanvirus.sg/places/serangoon-avenue-3](https://www.wuhanvirus.sg/places/serangoon-avenue-3), you can see that there was another case 89 who lives there too. If they are not family members, it's probably community spread from 89 to 92 living in the same area.

These are all conjectures, let's see if I'm proven right tomorrow. Or if pofma happens haha. One thing to note is that if these are true, looks like there's slightly more community spread today. covid19 is not going away soon.

Pretty interesting stuff by seeing the cases grouped by locations.

Sharing my experience/rant here as a caveat.

I was going to head out to settle some personal stuff and I decided to bring my laptop along so that I can hunker down and tackle my (urgent) work as soon as I'm done. I went to a relatively quiet Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf outlet in the West side which had quite a few empty seats.

Apparently they have a thing with people using laptops in the outlet, because 3 minutes after I sat down and got my drink a staff came over and told me they discourage the use of laptop during peak hours. She was also tapping on a sticker on the table (which I didn't scruntise but it looks like something to do with due to covid please avoid staying around too long in the cafe doing ""these things"", which include using laptops). I told her I'm just using it while I finish my drink and there are many empty seats around. She rebutted saying it's gonna be peak hours soon (in fact she said something like i work here I know when it's going to be peak hours) and laptop use is not encouraged. I ok'd her and she went away.

I thought I could at least finish my drink and leave since it seems that the cafe was an unwelcoming place, but 2 minutes later another staff approached me and told me it's apparently their POLICY that no laptops are allowed. At this point I'm completely flabbergasted and getting stressed and annoyed (that I'm just getting disrupted and distracted while trying to deal with work over &lt;10 minutes of laptop use), I just packed up and left. I also took my drink with me to only throw it away later, on hindsight I should have just left it there for them to clean up oh well.

Now if these ladies told me nicely that because of CoVID they are restricting the amount of time people are spending in the cafe by discouraging use of electonic devices AND warning all the people just talking loudly without masks over their coffees, watching videos on their ipads, reading a book, just plain zoning out in the cafe, or even just outright said ""we don't allow studying or working here"" I think I would be less angry. Whether for CoVID or they just don't want anyone loitering in the cafe without continuous spending, by targeting laptop use out of so many activities just left a bad taste for me.

I have been dealing with severe depression ever since before CB and it has only gotton worse. I felt suffocated by the laws and restrictions. Initially, it was hard for me to accept the fact that meeting my S/O (someone that helps me get through the days) was against the law. It was difficult for me to leave my house to have a breath of fresh air because of rules bounded by my family. As a 2020 graduate who’s awaiting for university to start, I have no proper commitments(e.g. work, school) during this period. I felt I lost my sense of purpose in life. Day after day of lying in bed not attending to my hobbies due to lack of interest, depression was hitting me hard.

I tried using logic to fight my heavy emotions and to assure myself that this was all for the better. To protect my family, my S/O and keep us safe. I tried making my time useful. I baked/attended online courses/did more housework; guided siblings in their homework, cooked and cleaned the house. But my breakdowns happened daily, I felt locked up at home.

I held onto hope and that there will be an end date for me to work towards (e.g. 4th May). The multiple changes to their schedule over the past few months have been torturing and caused frequent long hours of crying and suicidal thoughts.

Only just yesterday, I broke down for an hour(again) on why it was already Mid-June and that there was no announcement. I understood that Phase 2 allows me to visit S/O again and to leave the house without a purpose of “needing to buy essentials”. I wanted to stop being confined by these 4 walls, by rules and by judgment. And to be free.

And on 19th June, I can finally be free.



Note: I understand that Phase 2 does not mean the virus has been eradicated and we can be reckless. I don’t plan to crowd at populated areas, travel everywhere, and act as if everything is okay. I won’t be partying everyday at different houses, cafe-hopping, going on shopping sprees, etc. I just want to be with S/O and be able to leave my house without being constantly questioned by the law and by my family. I just want to feel okay again.

Trying to Gaviscon their manifesto -

 (Obviously just read the manifesto, this is not a complete and fair representation.)


(**Things in brackets are purely my opinion and do not represent PSP's views**)

YOU DESERVE BETTER:

1. Economic Development
2. Social Development
3. Political Development

**Economic Development** |  

- Vision : To **raise real wages**, Focus on local SMEs, Balance economic and environmental protection

- Action : Job priorities for locals | quota management for S/E pass/ work permits | wage management
		
        - Review CECA
		- Funding/supporting SMEs 
		- Balancing foreign labour with better equipment/processes instead
		- Moving to value-add/ higher-wage model
		- Workfare/cash portion to 80% | introduce living wage

*(What I would like to know: Details/numbers on how much ""change"" this will be, compared to the current funding/quota for the proposed actions.)*

**Social Development** |

- Vision :Improve social mobility, Education as the leveller, work-life balance to improve TFR, Affordable housing, social safety net
- Action :Increase Comcare/Covid assistance |CPF | Taxes | Housing

		- Increase cash assistance for people affected by Covid/ Comcare payout
		- CPF withdrawal, up to 50k at 55 years old.
		- Sale of En-bloc rights
		- Medisheild life to be borne by government
		- En-bloc Redev for all old flats 
		- New flats pegged to income levels/ lowering housing costs for younger people
		- Exempt basic necessities from GST/ freeze all tax&amp;fees increases for next 5 years

*(What I would like to know: Est Cost/time of these proposed changes, laid arguments for/against government funding/spending with regards to proposed actions. 
Saying cut public spending and taking from our wealth fund is vague and I would like to see options/opinions even if exact fund data is not available - i.e. At what level would proposed changes be unsustainable)*

**Political Development** | 

- Vision : Checks and balances to prevent abuse of power, uphold sacrifice and frugality, freedom of speech
- Action : Strengthen Alt. voice | Independant oversight on KAH | Public Service | POFMA

		- Reduce single dominant (90%) party representation in parliament (I assume this means reserving more seats for non-majority parties)
		- **MP salaries pegged to median income**
		- **Frugal public spending / Public transport and utilities to be non-profit** (good idea, but the costs of funding become a concern.)
		- Presendential oversight on Key public appointments, no COI for people in these positions (I believe this is an attempt to curb nepotism)
		- **Relax media/arts regulations and review POFMA**

*(What I would like to know: How likely they believe this to pass given the current political system, arguments against the ""highly paid so not corrupt"" stance, 
Specifics on what regulations will be relaxed and which portions of POFMA would be reviewed)*


*If it matters they have a cute Otter plushie named Otica as their mascot(?).


Overall this is just a manifesto and does not detail their plans. While interesting to propose, a lot of disscussion/arguments can and need to be made with their policies. If someone from PSP actually reads this it and addresses them, it will be awesome.

hkydod,1593841996,hkydod,23,,"We are not contesting this election, but here are some key points of our manifesto if we did contest. The Singapore Nationalist Party pledges to always look out for the interests of the True Blue Singaporean. 

Stances: Immigration and external affairs(see section on free trade agreements) we are right wing. Internal affairs we are left wing.

&amp;#x200B;

* Education

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be guaranteed places in top and branded schools for Primary 1 registration, within their vicinity, or in vicinities nearby.
2. School branding will be taken away. 
   1. We intend to make good on the ruling party's ""Every school is a good school"", which they have failed to attain as an ideal. We intend to use this initiative to bring up the standard of Singapore education as a whole.
   2. The campus will be absorbed into the purview of branded schools and become branches of branded schools. 
   3. That would mean the consigning of non-branded schools and their histories to walls, rooms, or halls around the campus.  
3. For polytechnic education, there will be a compulsory ""academic and presentation competencies"" course that all polytechnics students will have to go through to reduce the discrepancies in some ""basic skills"" between institutions.
4. For tertiary education, we will dismantle the private institutions, and have the campuses used by them put into the purview of the autonomous universities, just like non-branded schools in Primary and Secondary level. 
   1. The admission into the autonomous universities will still follow the present system. 
   2. Those that do not make the cut into the main campus can include the consideration of the branches in their university application. 
   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus. 
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree. 
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&amp;#x200B;

* Car Ownership and Transport

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&amp;#x200B;

* Home Ownership

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects. 
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&amp;#x200B;

* National Service

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress. 
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.
2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&amp;#x200B;

* Voting Age

1. Voting age should be 18. 
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&amp;#x200B;

* Universal Basic Income

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&amp;#x200B;

* Public Spending

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5. 
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again. 
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&amp;#x200B;

* Population Numbers

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015. 
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&amp;#x200B;

* Jobs, Foreigners working in Singapore 

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by. 
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again. 
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&amp;#x200B;

* Foreign Worker Dormitories

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened. 
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard. 
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

* LGBTQ+

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced""). 
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices. 
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society. 
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&amp;#x200B;

* Foreign Interference in Local Affairs

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic. 
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"". 
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

On the other hand, WP kicked off with perhaps one of the strongest line ups ever. So did PSP, with Tan ""Hypebeasts"" Cheng Bock riding on the unhappy memories reserved presidency to garner widespread support.

Still, TCB was not elected. Nicole Seah was not elected. And if not for the very positive reception Jamus ""Cockles"" Lim got after the election debates, I doubted Seng Kang would have went into the oppos hands. 

This election shows how stacked the cards are in PAPs hands.

This [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z) from Singapore research is far more useful.

There are 3 major arms to viral immunity - innate, humoral (ie antibody) and cell-mediated immunity.  The innate immunity defends you until adaptive immunity (latter two) kicks in.

We already know now that antibody immunity to a natural infection fades fast.  This will be bad news for the Sinovac vaccine which will only spur the antibody response.  **Unless the body responds differently to vaccination than a natural infection**, that inactivated virus vaccine will only provide a brief protection.  Singapore invested in [Novavax](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00937/full) whose vaccine candidate can be expected to have the same limitations.

That leaves a number of other vaccines that should generate both humoral and cell-mediated responses.  The Oxford and CanSino vaccines are based on engineered viruses.  The Moderna and Imperial College ones are actually adapted gene therapy vehicles.  Singapore also [invested](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-biontech-placement/temasek-led-investor-group-in-250-million-vaccine-bet-on-germanys-biontech-idUKKBN2400PS) into [BioNTech](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/us_trials_of_pfizerbiontech_coronavirus_vaccine_start_1339865)'s candidate which falls in this category.  All target the S protein.

What the Singapore work shows is that the earlier SARS outbreak established very long-lasting immunity against SARS that also covers SARS-2.  That also included CD8+ T-cells that play a key role in killing infected cells.  As SARS-2 as similar to SARS, there is reasonable hope that these other new vaccines could also elicit long-term immunity.  However, they did not study the S protein that those other vaccines are based on so we don't actually know if long-term T-cell immunity can be generated against that.  It will be a ""game over"" downer for all candidates if it can't.  Couldn't at least one effort have selected the NP protein instead?  Groupthink.

They also show that even some uninfected people have cell-mediated immunity against SARS-2.  This may have arisen from infections by other unknown coronaviruses.

So SG has two tickets in the vaccine lottery.  I think one is more likely to be a bust.  Better pray the other is strikes gold.",,"Singapore research - ""SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls""",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hsv9yx/singapore_research_sarscov2specific_t_cell/

Hey r/Singapore,

I am an NTU undergrad student currently working on a project regarding on fake news with my prof.

Our goals for this project are: 1) To publish a research paper analyzing fake news/ forwarded messages in SEA 2) Hopefully create a website to debunk fake news in Asia (think of Snopes.com etc) 

I currently have above 100 screenshot messages from Whatsapp/Telegram collected from my relatives and friends but more data is appreciated, especially in light of the current Wuhan virus scare (which I didn't know had fake news/forwarded messages spreading already until today's thread). 

I would have created a new thread but I don't have enough karma :(

It would be a great help if you all can screenshot the content and background (if there are any) of the messages and PM me the screenshot! It would be best to remove/ shade away the contact name/ number.

gaa1kl,1588169053,gaa1kl,24,,"Due to the current Co-Vid situation, the gov is subsidizing 75% of employee's pay (essentially only 60+% cus the subsidy doesn't cover employer's CPF contribution). My employer is trying to use this 60+% to cover 100% of employee's wages by making employees use their annual paid leave.

The employer is trying to cover the remaining 30+% by enforcing the use of annual leave on specified days (employees cannot choose which day they want). Employees are made to take more than a week of leave to cover that 30+%, when the entitled annual leave is only 14 days.

So question here, are employers allowed to do that?  


Another question also! when an employee takes more than 14 days of annual entitled leave, the employer doesn't use the no pay leave system. The employer makes it negative. So, for every extra day on top of the 14 entitled days you take, it becomes a negative day and will accumulate over the years that you work until you leave the company then they'll minus it off your last month's pay. So for example, if over the years, you accumulate -30days, your last month of work at the company is essentially unpaid.

I'm at my wits' end in finding a nursing home for my grandmother who's suffering from dementia. Things have gotten worse in the household with her deteriorating dementia, and I desperately need any help/advice when it comes to looking for one.
I underwent procedures via social workers, but the most that has been done was getting a caretaker for her. However, things are not going well at all and ultimately a nursing home is the most suitable option.

COVID-19 has made this very tough, of course. The social workers have told me that I would have to wait anywhere from 6 months to a year to find her a home, but I believe there has to be a shorter waiting time. On top of that, they have informed me of a $2400/week home for her, which is a price point I simply cannot meet.

Optimally, I would want the cheapest possible home with the sufficient care that she needs, ASAP.

That said, I know it is difficult with the global pandemic that is going on; but if anyone in the profession could reach out a helping hand, I will be eternally grateful.

(Credit: David Kiu on Facebook) 

I rarely post on FB apart from the odd vacation post, mainly because I believe everyone is entitled to their point of view and I seldom see the need to share mine. I’ve posted on climate change, conservation and similar topics in the past because these have enduring significance and impact and I thought important enough to share some views. The elections this coming Friday will also be an event of enduring impact in Singapore, hence I thought to post some thoughts.

I can understand the many grievances that have been voiced against the ruling party. Certainly much of the unhappiness is real. Life is a rat race from the time we go to school, throughout our working life and even post retirement as we need more funds given we live longer lives now. Even after slogging, there is no iron rice bowl and things continue to get more expensive and life continues to get more competitive, with foreign talent in our schools and workplaces. It can feel like life is neither good nor fair. Has the ruling party really done a good job? Have they lost their way? Do they have our best interests at heart? Do they listen, or know what is really needed? Do they deserve the vote for the next five years? Should we hand the reins to the opposition? Will they do a better job? Will having more opposition voices make things better? These are legitimate questions. Ultimately everyone needs to come to a conclusion about these questions for themselves this Friday because we are voting for the future of our families. The below is just my personal view about five grievances I’ve heard championed by some of the opposition parties in some form or other.

First, is a grievance that life is getting tougher and the government has failed us. On this, I think it’s worth remembering that it is a fact that Singapore is a tiny island nation with no resources. One that could easily become irrelevant to the rest of the world. This one fact means we are destined to hustle. It means we need to carve our own relevance. It means we need to force the rest of the world to want or need us. That means working harder and smarter than everyone else so others don’t eat our lunch. If you want to be a Singaporean, there’s no escape from this reality.

To be Singapore is to constantly fight for relevance. It doesn’t matter which political party is in power or what the balance is in Parliament, life will never be easy in Singapore because of this fact. If you want an easy life, you have a better chance emigrating as many have done in the past. It doesn’t cost anything for someone to paint a picture of an easier life to win votes, and it is tempting to believe it is possible. But you had better be sure because if you buy into it only to realise later you’ve been sold a pipe dream, it will be too late to earn back the hard fought position and relevance that has taken decades to build. I generally view with suspicion anyone offering an easy solution for an easier life because that’s just irresponsible and ignoring the reality of our circumstances.

Second, is a grievance that the system is not equitable or that we don’t have enough social mobility. There are many different variations of this grievance and it manifests in unhappiness with ministerial salaries, or in the tuition epidemic, or in “elite” vs “neighbourhood” schools, and so on. Some of this resonates with me. My heart breaks every time I see an elderly person having to sell tissue paper or collect cardboard. This is not the Singapore I want.

The truth is that there is indeed social and income inequality in Singapore. But this is also evident in every society. You only have to look at the waves of protests around the world in the last few months to know this. For us, we came from a society that was equally poor a generation ago, so any progress from that point will by definition be more unequal. My parents were not graduates but their children, my sister and I, were both able to graduate and find good jobs, thanks to their hard work to provide for us. Not everyone was as lucky. More can and should certainly be done to make sure that no one is left behind and that everyone has a chance to move up.

To close this gap, there are only three ways. Lower the penthouse, raise the basement, or build a lift. Lowering the penthouse is generally a bad idea as it is a disincentive, so we are left with the other two options.
Both will require the government to be able to invest more which requires that we can continue growing our economy. Without that, we will never be able to afford the social investments and mobility we need. To dish out more from a shrinking pie will just cause the pie to shrink faster. Anyone can say that we need to invest more in this or that. But the reality is that you cannot have more investment in education, in healthcare, in social assistance, in innovation, all at once. Social investment is one area where the community can and should do more rather than just rely on the government. I generally view with suspicion anyone who tells me I can have my cake and eat it, because you can be sure you will be charged for two cakes later.

Third, is a grievance that the government has allowed too many foreigners to compete and take jobs at the expense of equally qualified locals. This is a delicate issue. Most of us at some point have probably thought to ourselves, “I could have done that job just as well or better, so they must have hired that other person instead because he/she was cheaper foreign talent or they hired their own (assuming the hiring manager is also foreign).” We rarely think, maybe we are not competitive or not hungry enough.

The fact is that companies are just looking to hire the best person for the job at the best cost, regardless of the nationality. And increasingly also regardless of the location. I’ve never heard of a company wanting to hire a less capable and less qualified person who is also more expensive. I probably wouldn’t want to work for a company like that anyway as it won’t last too long. As many people have now been working remotely for several months, companies are also realising that many jobs can be just as easily performed in Singapore, or Mexico, or Egypt, or Rwanda, or any number of places where the quality could be just as good for a fraction of the cost.

So to force a company to hire a Singaporean in Singapore at several times the cost yet at the same level of capability will more likely cause jobs to leave Singapore and result in fewer opportunities for everyone here. The only true solution is not to force companies here to hire more expensive Singaporeans, everything else being equal, but to help Singaporeans become the best candidates. Or else we go back to the first scenario, that Singapore becomes irrelevant and unnecessary.

By all means ensure that companies hire fairly and give jobs to equally qualified locals. But would anyone really want to be hired even though they are the worse candidate, just because they are local? Some countries do that but that is not a road that leads to sustainable competitiveness. I generally view with suspicion anyone claiming to be able to protect my job for me, because generally no one can do that for you if you don’t do it for yourself.

Fourth, is a grievance that we need more diverse and dissenting voices to ensure checks and balances (aka no blank cheque), and give more voice to those whose interests are not represented. This is quite a fashionable point of view, because it sounds appealing in theory to have more scrutiny or debate.

The strange thing to me about this though is that those that claim to offer this rarely really offer any view that is not already being heard. Just because the final decision is not one that represents the minority view, doesn’t mean that the diverse views were not considered or consulted. In the end, no decision can make everyone happy and the job of the government is to make the best decision for the majority, while continually listening and taking into account the needs of the minority. In the pandemic response for instance, the first wave of support did not do enough for self-employed persons and this feedback was heard and addressed in subsequent waves.

Indeed, it feels more likely that the opposite risk is more worrisome, which is that of creating populist politics that force governments to make decisions that pander to vocal minorities or provide temporary benefits, at the expense of long term interests or the silent majority. Or worse, prevent governments from making unpopular decisions for the long term benefit of the majority because of the loud voices of the vocal minority.

After all, a tax hike may be the right thing to do but will never be popular and not having a strong government to push such policies through will mean that we shy away from the tough decisions needed. Imagine if the government does not receive a strong mandate. Then the next time they are faced with a potentially unpopular but right decision, they will naturally think twice because it could cost more votes. Would we want a government that avoids making tough decisions even though they are the right ones?

What we actually need is a government that really listens well and makes policies that benefit the majority of the people for the long term. Having more opposition doesn’t necessarily create this. It is created by strengthening the institutions that represent these interest groups, whether it is the arts, or SMEs, or religious groups, or others. Some of our NMPs for example have done a great job of this. I generally find suspicious anyone asking for votes solely on the basis that they can be a check and balance, because it usually means they are not really bringing anything else valuable to the table.

Fifth, is a more recent argument that the new generation of leaders in government is not as capable, evidenced by how the COVID response has apparently been a failure, and then that somehow this is proof that a parliament with more opposition would have done better. On the COVID response, there are certainly opportunities to improve but I believe the fairer characterisation is more success than failure. Could we have locked down earlier, or introduced quarantine earlier to prevent imported cases, or acted earlier to stop the dormitory spread? Maybe. All great with hindsight.

But looking at the current situation around the world, I struggle to find examples of any other countries that have performed better in managing this crisis. I for one would rather get COVID in Singapore than anywhere else in the world. We are not yet out of this but I am certain when we look back after all the dust has settled, we will find that what we have accomplished is a rare feat that most countries will be envious of.

One personal anecdote. The company I work for has opted to return or refuse COVID related government relief funds all around the world, on the principle that these funds would be better spent helping others in more need. While working on this, I found that nowhere in the world were relief funds disbursed as quickly or without the burden of red tape, as it was in Singapore. While others were still scrambling to work out what to do, Singapore had already put money into people’s hands.

Would it have been as fast if we needed to debate every aspect of this in parliament? Would a parliament with more opposition resulted in a better or faster outcome? I struggle to see how this could happen. I generally view with suspicion anyone promising improved speed or better outcomes without showing how they would achieve this, because words are cheap.

During election season, it’s normal that opposition parties come out with campaign promises that criticise the status quo and promise an attractive alternative. No one will vote for you otherwise. I don’t blame the opposition parties for appealing to these grievances. It’s just the nature of politics.

It’s difficult sometimes to try to address these grievances because the feelings are real and that needs to be acknowledged rather than made to feel invalid. When the ruling party does this, it creates a sense that they are disconnected or not listening by trying to tell people you should not think or feel this way.

Hard truths are difficult to tell, especially during election season. It doesn’t make you popular or win you votes. But these grievances and arguments need to be examined closely to also remove the false promises behind them. That’s the job of the voter, distinguishing between the empty promises of those appealing for your vote, and real policies that will make life better.

In my mind, one test is this. If we rewind the clock to the start of the year, would I trust any of these opposition candidates to do a better job? Some of them were already in parliament so actually the question is, if we had a few more of these other ones, would I feel more comfortable and confident? Or less? During a crisis is when we most need the best government we can have. There is no bigger crisis than the one we are still in.

As I said at the start, ultimately each of us must come to our own conclusions. Our earlier generations have worked hard to put us where we are now. At the very least, we owe it to them, to ourselves and to our families to reflect on our choices and be sure for ourselves which is the mirage and which is truly the oasis.

hpt4le,1594554257,hpt4le,24,,"You are likely to have read your fill of post-election articles and analyses by now. I know I have. But if you have the time for just one more post, then I’ll share my thoughts on one particular group of people who should also take this time to engage in some serious self-reflection. 

And that group is ourselves. Each and every one of us.

We need to recognize how elections in democratic systems sometimes end up being very similar to team sports. We also need to see what dangers this brings. But most of all, we need to do so much more if we are going to heal as a nation from this point onwards.

It’s perhaps impossible to avoid getting swept up in the fervor of elections. There are dozens of different issues to discuss, and dozens more perspectives to consider. It’s easy then to take comfort in clear, simple concepts, concepts like “No Blank Cheques”, or “Don’t Fearmonger”. Say I feel strongly about a certain issue. There’s a party which echoes my views. Not much more to consider, is there?

But while that approach works well for the sporting industry, it has less of a place in politics. That is because there are no simple fixes when it comes to governance. Governance is complex, and governance is messy. There’s no silver bullet. If you believe that any one political party has all the answers, then well, I have some magic beans I would like to sell you.

Approaching politics like team sports makes us forget all of that. In many discussions I dipped my toes into before the elections, both online and in real life, my sense was that not enough energy was being spent on the bigger questions. Instead, people were focused on why one party was better than another. Or why one scandal exemplifies the rot and decay in a party. Or why another personal indiscretion invalidates that person from contributing in Parliament. 

More worryingly, as debates and discussions heated up, the conversation always sunk lower and lower until it became trash talk. Polarization happened before my eyes. A zero-sum game emerged from nowhere. If you are not on my side, then you are my enemy, and I will stop at nothing until I have victory.

To that, I say this, and there’s really no way I can make this clearer – we are all on the same side. 

The elections are over. The next time we do this dance again is in another five or so years. But that doesn’t mean that our duties as citizens are over. To become stronger, I thought of 3 things we could work on in the meantime:

1. We need to listen better to our fellow Singaporeans. You likely would have encountered discussions on topics that were not relevant to you. But don’t just dismiss these issues. These issues were of dire importance to others. What were other people genuinely worried about? Were there any blind-spots in your worldviews? Are you as open-minded as you thought? 

1. We need to realize that we can each make a difference too. The government may be in the driving seat, but you can still help to check the map for directions. Think about what you can do to directly influence or help others with their problems. Surprise yourself with the positive changes you can help bring.

1. Most of all, we need to heal as a nation. Is there really a need to rehash victories or losses as if we were discussing the fortunes of sporting teams? Any value to labelling people by how they voted? Instead of driving the division, why not reach out to people from across the political lines? You’ll be surprised at how much you have in common with each other. Build bridges, not walls.

There’s a whole new uncertain world out there for us to tackle. We will still be feeling the social and economic effects of the pandemic for months if not years. 

As we go through those tumultuous times, I would very much like to know that it’s alongside other people like you, people with real faces, real identities, real hearts… people who are willing to help others weather any storms together.",,Moving on from GE 2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hpt4le/moving_on_from_ge_2020/

Contary to many speculations: jobs, COVID, and the economy is surprisingly low with less than half indicating that it matters when voting.

One reading is that PAP has made significant legislative mistakes that cost them, particularly in transparency and POFMA / elections.

The other major mistake is the candidate field by PAP vs opposition, where PAP candidates are lackluster while WP had multiple PhDs and degrees holders. Hopefully, PAP will take the que and field better candidates.

Fear of the unknown is also a huge factor, especially considering an opposition wipeout vs as opposition win in 2015, which is likely to contribute to the major swing in 2015. What this means is that politics in 2025 will be one where PAP will sell the fear that they will lose the parliament and paint WP as powerful as possible, appealing to emotion rather than reason.

I am thinking of applying this year but I have some doubts and I hope yall can clarify them. Also, I only want to do my phd at US and I am aware that the most important thing is to ensure that it is funded.

Should I apply for ASTAR NSS scholarship? The upside of getting this is that it will be easier for me to get into top phd programs as these programs do not need to fund me. I am considering this as I am afraid my profile is not good enough considering I have no publication while successful applicants on gradcafe easily have at least 1 publication. 

However, the downside of getting this scholarship is that I will be bonded to the company for 5 years and the advice I read online have been to avoid getting bonded. I also do not want to get bonded as ASTAR research generally do not fit me although I do have skills required from ASTAR (did my research there before). 

In addition, will it be wiser to apply next year given the current pandemic and situation at US? Likewise, I intend to do RA after I graduate and fail this application round so as to improve my chance for grad school. Plus, I may be able to get something more concrete from my fyp though it is still too early to say. I plan to apply this year and next year but I am afraid I will not be able to make it for both of these years. I do not want to waste my time too just applying and am wondering at what point of time does anyone here stop applying if anyone experience the same situation?

Pros: It's good forward surveillance that overcomes some issues with testing only patients with respiratory symptoms (depends on their willingness to report sick in the first place). If the prevalence is indeed as low as the current rates suggest, we can use pooled testing to make sure it's not even that big a drain on resources (e.g. if 10 pooled samples return negative, we can clear them all. and it's likely we will get mostly pooled negatives given the low rate of community cases)

Putting this out there in the hopes that this could be something contemplated by the mysterious machinery of civil service (admittedly only for the office-going crowd...WFH is concededly a privilege that not all have access to). 

Why Wednesdays? I think it’s good to break up the work-week. Having it on Wednesdays will also ensure employees keep the momentum of work going in a traditional Monday to Friday work-week. Employees could come in on Wednesday if there are important physical meetings (e.g. with clients) - and substitute their WFH day for that week subject to approval. A midweek break from the visceral office environment and less than pleasant team dynamics might do wonders for mental health. 

Fears of diminished productivity with children at home will not be as significant, because children of school-going age will be away at school. Parents get to spend a bit more time with younger children below school-going age (3 days instead of 2). 

For those with elderly parents or grandparents living separately or at hospital / care-homes, I think the value of spending time / checking in (once more) during the week could be great benefit. 5 days of reduced contact could be very long for those that are in ailing health or lonely. I envision these care-home facilities, or cafes near these facilities, could provide some wifi or charging ports, if employees need to do urgent calls, or just wish to work by / close to the elderly’s side.

It would be good to have a work-day where we can be at home to run some errands that can only be typically done, or easier to schedule during the usual 9-5 weekday periods. For example, hair appointments, medical appointments, home maintenance services, errands / appointments at the Bank or other government agencies, etc. 

There are concerns about the blurring of work-life boundaries. I think that’s only predominant if all five workdays are spent at home (i.e. now during the circuit breaker). There are also concerns about reduced visibility and therefore productivity of employees. I think this could be addressed with employee training (e.g. one of those snazzy HR seminars on how to optimise productivity at home), and also, bosses who set or communicate clear expectations, or employees sharing what they set out to do during the day (but of course the employees retain discretion to do non-time-sensitive tasks at any hour of the day). 

Finally, I think it’d be nice that the retail landscape (e.g. malls, near residential estates) have their foot-fall and earnings spread out over 3 days, instead of 2. While I don’t think it would change the crowds for commutes significantly for the rest of the week, I think less car emissions and traffic on one more day the week might be a good step for the environment. Think of the infrastructure upgrades and maintenance (e.g. MRT repairs, or repairs in the office-building) that can be carried out mid-week by servicemen during reasonable hours.

But what I do know is that there are still several employees who have to work at the dorms due to the need for onsite management.

Well, now we've been in phase 2 for several weeks and I decided to pay them a visit, and I was happy to see booming business, a return to the original restaurant configuration and a full house like in the before times. 

But here's the rub: It was *exactly* like in the before times. Of the front crew sized 6 or 7 people only one person was wearing a mask. The counter staff, all the table runners were wearing none and being extremely cozy with the regulars - hugging, joining the parties at the different tables and laughing with them and so on. It seems extremely irregular.

I really don't want this good kitchen to get busted if some inspector comes by. I also don't want to confront them directly in case they think I'm a snitch and will spit in my soup next time I try to order something.

g1r5ul,1586954461,g1r5ul,26,,"Given the CB period, many more now have the time to come out and exercise or walk in our parks, which i find is absolutely delightful and beneficial to our physical and mental health. I also see almost everybody wearing mask, even some who are jogging and doing quite strenuous exercise.

However, given the rising number of un-linked cases, i am afraid that the authorities might (rightfully so) ban all outdoor activity if the situation worsens even further. This of course would be very detrimental to our health.

Given the situation, I strongly believe that we must act now to protect our ability to go outside and exercise or walk etc. Hence I would like to propose some ideas.

1. Staggered timings for exercising in parks. Odd number NRICs (as in the last digit of your NRIC is an odd number) can go in the morning for odd number days, while even number NRICs can go in the evening, vice versa. Front-line workers who may only get to exercise in the evening can be an exception.

2. Try to avoid the popular timings (which is around 7-8 in the morning and 5-7 in the evenings).

3. Try not to cluster on the bridges or other narrow places to view nature or stretch, might inadvertently cause  a cluster to form

4. Limit the amount of time spent. Try to cut down on the time spent exercising and compensate by doing static exercises at home.

5. Try to use alternative runways. The parks ,may have one or more paths, try to take the less congested path even if it may be longer, then compensate from there.

6. wear mask if not doing strenuous exercise. And for those that are doing strenuous exercise, wear mask while walking to the location

7. Try not to run side by side people, especially if the wind is blowing towards you, overtake or slow down if necessary.

8. Wash your hands when you get back home immediately!!!!

9. Try to limit the number of people going out with you. While i know this is excellent time for family bonding, a whole family of 5 coming out together seems excessive at this point. Maybe mommy and daddy can bring the kids separately based on the NRIC rule also.

gobm40,1590117795,gobm40,26,,"  Hi guys I was really hesitant to post this here because I wasn't sure if this was the right platform to seek advice but I'm running out of options.  

  Well, to give some context, my mother and I have had a rocky relationship. It's been tough living in this house with her due to her oppressive nature. She's prone to throwing fits and picking fights with not just me but my father and older sister too.  I have clashed with her on several occasions and they always turn into shouting matches that leave me utterly exhausted and broken. Most of the time, I'm forced to retreat to my room and bawl my eyes out before she can even listen to reason. 

  She's an extremely stubborn individual who has to be right in every argument, regardless of who her opponent is. Before CB, she was already cooped up at home all the time due to her job which could have contributed to her mood swings. But, she could at least go out during the weekends or no one would be around for most of the day for her to vent her anger on. Now, we are all stuck in this decrepit hellhole together and she's driving me mad. 

  Initially, she agreed to pay my poly fees for me which made me genuinely appreciative of her. And I was also looking forward to going to campus. Then, news of Covid-19 and CB appeared,effectively rendering me stranded at home with her.  Yesterday, she suddenly sprang the news on me that I had to pay half when I start to work. This would have been fine if she didn't agree to pay for me in the first place. An argument ensued and she just would not back down and admit she backed down on her word,citing that she is doing this so that I will work. However, all I have been doing is studying in my room in a bid to avoid her. And she is fully aware of that and she even called me crazy for studying so much. After I brought this up, she tried to change topic and cited that it was a way of teaching me the value of money. The argument grew more ferocious to the point when I just told her she was driving me mad and she had the gall of retorting with ""I'm the one who's going mad"". This was the last straw for me.

  I've tried talking to her and asking her to change. We even sat down as a family to talk to her. Nothing has worked. I'm thinking of leaving the house and going somewhere else to stay  for a while to get away from her. But, I don't have anyone from my family to turn to as they would most likely send me back to live with her in spite of my protests. And my dad doesn't allow me to leave either despite how much of a tyrant she is. My best bet is to move to my best friend's house but I'm not allowed to due to the CB measures in place right now. So, I'm really at a loss and decided to write here to vent and to ask for advice.",,Dealing with a toxic parent during CB period,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gobm40/dealing_with_a_toxic_parent_during_cb_period/

* Don't buy food from stalls that are worked on by mainlanders, since they may have Wuhan virus. Don't use food delivery services, because you need to ensure that the chefs are not mainlanders.
* Refuse face-to-face interaction with mainlanders at work and ask boss for alternative arrangements (e.g. work from home).

They also suggested that government should deport all mainlanders till it dies down and stop the flow of mainlanders to Singapore.

f2borm,1581442302,f2borm,27,,"I'm making this post half asleep after work but hopefully it can spark a fruitful discussion. I'm just surprised people don't know about price inflation. Maybe people never learnt it or simply forgot they learnt it back in Secondary school.

&amp;#x200B;

**First of all, what is ""Price Gouging"" ?** 

There is no hard definition but loosely, it means to sell an essential item at an ""unreasonably"" high price during a natural disaster or other crisis. It is generally viewed that people who increase the prices of these essential items are ""profiteering"", taking advantage of people's desperate need for said item.

But if we remove the moral bias from it, it simply is a spike in price due to a combination if increase in demand and lowering supply. AKA, an inflation.

Take note that I an not an economist major but I am recalling stuff that I learnt back in secondary's school basic POA/economics class many years ago.

I draw a simple demand and supply graph to illustrate this point

[https://imgur.com/a/59ReH7Q](https://imgur.com/a/59ReH7Q)

Basically, as demand increases and supply decreases, it creates a shortage at current price. To achieve market equilibrium, a new increased price is reached to address the shortage.

**Why is this a good thing?**

(1) It is a visible distress signal to the market indicating a immediate shortage in supply and/or an urgent demand. The sudden price increase will attract new suppliers to come into the market and/or incentivise current suppliers to ramp up their supplies  to meet the demand.

(2) It diverts the resources to areas that most need them. If both country A and country B has the same amount of item but country A needs it more, they will increase the price of said item, indicating they are willing to pay more. Diverting the item to the area with higher demand.

(3) It increases the value of an item and change the general behavioral use of said item. It disincentives using the item is frivolous ways and more care and thought is put into the use of said item. You will think twice before wasting said item.

(4) It prevents general hoarding. If the price remain at status quo during and increase demand and decreased supply, it creates a shortage, encouraging people to hoard more than necessary. Increasing the price naturally decreases a person's buying power of the item hence will buy lesser of it, letting more people have a chance of getting the item.

(5) It encourages searching for alternatives. If item A is out of reach, searching for the next best thing will become priority.

**What if the price is forced to remain the same?**

Because the idea of ""price gouging"" is seen as an immoral act, some countries and states have put a type of anti-price gouging law, to prevent price increases during natural disasters or crisis. In such cases, 

(1) There is no increased incentive to increase the supply to fulfill the demand. People are motivated by profit and if the demand is large and the profit does not justify increasing workload to increase supply, people simply won't do the work.

(2) Other areas that are willing to pay more will get the supply. If price is kept artificially low due to Country A's law but the Country B is willing to pay more for said item, you'd be stupid to supply to Country A.

(3) It extends shortage period. Back in point (1), no one want to supply, shortage remains.

**What about the poor?**

In the short term, it would be bad for them. But in a scenario where item is available at an increased price vs a scenario where item is simply not available due to shortage, the former scenario would be better.

Government or charity bodies can chose to buy at a higher price to be re-distributed to the poor. If the item is simply not there due to shortage, these charities can't help the poor even if they want to.

Also, as supply increase due to high demand and price, competition will come into play as suppliers will try to undercut each other to better serve the demand, eventually reaching a lower price equilibrium.

**Why don't the government just confiscate from those selling at high price and redistribute to the people?**

This is one of the worst idea anyone could think of. Basically it signals to the market this country is going to steal your product. Why would anyone willing to supply in a country knowing that any time, their products could simply be confiscated? Suppliers will basically stay away from that country.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal opinion on the mask shortage**

Its actually very funny. We have not reach crisis level yet and people KPKB likes its the worst thing in the world when people mark up prices of masks.

We never been in a real natural disaster before where water bottles can cost $20 dollar per bottle or petrol costing $30 per liter.

The world, not just Singapore, the entire freaking WORLD, is facing a shortage of disposable face mask simply because the law of supply and demand is gravitating all the supply to the country that needs it most, China. They need it more than we do. We can still go without masks with low to medium risk of contracting the virus. They have it at HIGH.

Try to invest in one of those reusable face masks. The surgical and N95 masks should be left for professional medical staff that are in direct danger of getting the virus. A normal face mask should be good enough to prevent most aerosolized particles from the air.

Understand you can choose not to buy from sellers who you believe they are pricing the items to high. If they are not making a profit or moving their product, eventually they will lower back their prices, especially if people are undercutting them.

My dad is a taxi driver and has been complaining that there is 1-2 calls per day and he works from morning till night time. He also claims that the company hasnt done anything yet and he still have to pay rental fee and all. oil prices are expensive as well and the profit he earned is not even enough to pay for the rent/oil fees. after the circuit breaker starts next week, this situation would get worsen.. and im very worried because he has been borrowing money to pay off rental fee

Im not too sure if grab came out anything to ease the financial burden of the drivers but if they havent/do not plan to do so, its rlly very unethical of them. Yes, reducing collection of rental fees may cause them to lose profit but at this current situation, other than companies that sells mask/sanitiser, who else are earning? they cant just earn from the drivers when they cant even find customers to drive.

A little more context for my fam, my parents are quite old, my mum had cancer and my dad have to fetch her to hospital and then back home, so shes not earning already. my dad is the sole bread winner at home but he dont even have enough money to pay for rental fee. How are we gna survive thru this shit. I worked part time as a private tutor while studying in Uni and because of this circuit breaker thing, the parent has requested for suspension of tuition. right now, we are only living off from my mothers savings and say real, this is def not a long term solution.

gkut30,1589636334,gkut30,27,,"I come from a single parent family and I wish it is not. I really do not know what to do, I feel like crap everyday because my mother has been really bad to my entire family. My dad is a Singaporean and mom is from China but is now a Singaporean citizen. They married each other after only knowing each other for a year and a half. After marrying, she had my brother, then me, who is a year younger.

I remember when I was in kindergarten my dad and mom were still together, from what I can remember as a child they were okay to each other when I was in kindergarten. However, my mom brought both my older brother and I to watch movies and go outing with this guy (Person A) who isn’t my dad, who claims to be her “friend”. I was young back then thus I didn’t know anything. I do not remember anything else in kindergarten as it was too long ago. A few years had passed and I’m in primary school. My parents have been arguing a lot more and they started fighting. I do not know if it’s true but from what I can remember, my mom started hitting my father first, when my father tried to defend himself, accidentally pushed a thing people used to hang their clothes, and scratched her. I can still clearly hear it in my head, my mother shouting in Chinese “你是什么男人打女人” which roughly translates to “what kind of a guy are you to hit a girl”. I vaguely remember my dad as a “nice” guy, very calm and will think before he acts. I really do not know who started the fight first. During p3ish period, I can remember clearly that my dad asked me if my mom has been out with other guys. I don’t know how to answer so I just said yes. Apparently this lead to them having a divorce. I am really tired... When they divorced, I wasn’t even told about it. They divorced during my p6 period and I won’t say it affected my results for PSLE, so I’d say I was just really stupid. After divorced, I rarely see my dad and thus leading to me asking my mom. My mom said that my dad has a mistress, and doesn’t have time for us. Bear in mind this was in primary 6 when she told me this, I don’t know shit about marriage and shit when my mom told me to choose my dad or her. When I told her I don’t want this family to be broken, she scolded me for it. She keeps telling me my dad doesn’t want me at all and wants no contact with me. My brother and I had no choice in other words. My brother is a year older than me. He took his PSLE and got 10 marks higher than me. My mom always think I am the “smarter” one. When I got 10 marks lower than my brother she “said” it was fine and all because you tried, just work hard in the future. I blamed myself for not doing well but the past cant be changed. Around this period, my mom told me that my dad does not even care about us anymore, not giving the fees where the guy is supposed to give to the girl. My dad was earning 2-3k a month during that time. My mom however was earning WAYY more because of something that I am not comfortable saying. She always says how useless is my dad, saying how he only earns that amount of money. After my results collection for PSLE, my dad still arranges Sunday catch ups with him. My mom will then tell both of us to ask him for money. I know my dad is supposed to give money to support us but I really do not know anything. My mom usually tells and show us about my dad and his girlfriend to keep reminding us we were not wanted. My dad is honestly shit. After a few weeks of catching up on sundays, we stopped. I do not know what happened but he stopped.
During secondary school period, I was determined to do well and not be shit, but I always missed having a complete family. I remember during sec 1 buying of uniform, my classmate’s dad helped me to choose. I felt like shit. People have been encouraging me about single parent family and I know it is normal most children come from a single parent family. During secondary school my mom became more violent and “abusive” shouting words like go die, get out of the house and never come back to my brother and I when we were in the fault. During secondary 1-2 period, having a smartphone was a “must have” for everyone because “everyone has it”. When someone doesn’t have it people will judge. My mom didn’t allow my brother or I to have one during sec 1-2, so I would save up using my allowance to buy one. Once I got caught she would smash it and shout at my brother or I. When we told her that other classmates all have a smartphone she says this “then go to other peoples house and live”. I would say she usually scold us/beats us at least once a week. I remember when she used to scold us for hiding test papers/ playing games without her permission, she would scold the hell out us. She at times told us to get out of the house, when we tried to argue back. I remember after a few hours or so, she would tell my grandma, her mother to come find us. My grandma usually lives with us to help ease my moms labour. We used to have maids during kindergarten but my mom always scolded them and stuff, therefore not having one after secondary sch. During secondary 2 or 3, it all kind of changed when she introduced her “friend”, person A to us as her boyfriend. She became nice and all and person A was very nice to us. Person A really thought of us a lot and treat us like his own. I am definitely grateful. He calmed my mother down when she was about to scold and hit us, and he talked with my mother on how to “treat” us, by using brains and not brute force. We naturally became better , however we do make mistakes here and there. During one instance, my brother had a fight with my mother, and person A came to help my mother. Person A smashed all the devices my brother owned and “beat” him. My brother then said that he wasn’t even our dad, he has no rights to “punish” us. My brother is really a fucking dumb ass when he said that. I know better to not say that and suck it up when he “punished” me when I was wrong. This then lead to person A not being with my mom afterwards as my brother can not accept him. My mom then returned being “abusive” after a few months. She would scold/beat us when she feels like it, because of her job. She then worked as a tour guide, dealing with Chinese people. She would look down on them when they don’t buy souvenirs and stuff and scold them for it? After her work when I speak to her she would usually be angry and I would try not to agitate her. During this period, my grandma has already went back, so my brother and I tried and do everything we can, we would be lazy sometimes and skip housework and all. I think during sec 2 or 3, my mom finally could buy a hdb and so she did. My grandpa and grandma would come visit for a few months as my mom told them she got a house etc.. After a month, my mom had a very bad fight with my grandpa, her father, which lead to him straight away booking a ticket to fly back. My grandma would stay and take care of us again as our O levels are coming. My mom would start to raise her voice at her, her own mom, treating her like a “free” maid. After my brothers O level, he scored poorly and barely made it into poly. My mom essentially gave up on him and put all her hopes on me to perform well. After my O levels, I did better than my brother. I went to poly too but a different course. She says I can go poly but I must make it to uni. My mom always compares us to her friends child, saying how good they are, and not the bad ones. It is really tiring. She usually talks very loudly at home with her bunch of friends. After my O levels, my grandma went back. My brother and I would talk back to my mother when she is “unreasonable” but ultimately we would apologize. She always use the same old scolding, “go die, get out of MY house” and many more. My cousin, will then come to Singapore to study during my poly y1 period. My grandma would follow her and take care of her due to some reasons when her mom, my aunt and uncle is not available. She was “the smartest” out of the whole family, claiming it is really easy in Singapore. 
During my o levels, my mom would promise me to buy me stuff like a laptop, which she did buy for my brother and a bike, when I scored well during sec 2. This bike has never came and the laptop came as $2k cash after 1 year and a half. She does not keep up with her promises. I never really asked my mom for anything unlike my brother, always wanting good clothes etc. I am very sure my mom bought way more things for my brother than I but I never “complain” about it. I kinda know how hard to be the sole breadwinner for the family. My cousin after a semester in sec 2 failed most of her subjects. My mom used to always say to learn from ur little cousin, how good she is etc... It really is repetitive. I am just done.
Fast forward to this year, covid-19 occurred. This lead to my mom being jobless because of most flights being cancelled, so she went to find a job that can support us through this period. I helped her in every way possible, helping her translate most of her mails and helping her do her taxes, etc, the “adult”. I naturally complained since I have never been taught to do stuff like tax and other stuff like changing loan. I will then help her but at times tell her she was the one supposed to teach us how to do all these adult stuff. She would reply with “I give birth to u for what? Helping me only”. I feel like she is really unreasonable. Every time I taught her how to print/do those stuff, she would say she learnt already but will then come back to me to ask me how to do the exact same thing. I naturally still taught her again, although with some complains. She don’t ask my brother as she knows my brother would not help her, or only helps her when he likes to. She earns way lesser now as compared to pre covid-19, leading to her being more frustrated. For this entire period during covid, she has been really “angry” and raises her voice at everybody. Today, my mom came back from work, when she asked my brother to help pass her a snack, my brother however, did not want to, so he does not. My mom would start scolding about how garbage we were and is caused by our grandma being too nice to us. This is not related to my grandma at all and she somehow managed to drag her in. My mom then started raising her voice, in my opinion, scolded her mom. I couldn’t take her always scolding my grandma and treating her like how she treated past maids so I told her to not scold her mom. She became furious and shouted at me that she can do whatever she wants, this is her house, the usual. I then replied at least don’t shout and raise your voice to your own mother. She used to always raise her voice to my grandma. My mom then argued with me for 30 mins, when I asked her politely to not raise her voice at her mother. I then shouted back replying how she was “unreasonable” and how she should not raise her voice and scold her own mother. She thinks she’s always right and she thinks we hate her etc.. I just wanted to try and talk things out with her every time but it always leads to her scolding me, so today I shouted back at her, telling her if it was right to shout at her own mother. She then replied saying she never did. Hahaha. As if she never did. I then talked back to her saying how she mistreated her own mom. She told me to go die, get out of her house and she says I do what I want. Wtf is that logic? I am trying to talk things out with her at first but she keep bringing up stuff like “your dad doesn’t even want u”, “it’s not my responsibility to take care of u”, “go die and my life would be easier” and “get out of my house”. I just really can’t handle it anymore. She’s so unreasonable and she thinks of herself as god and think she is always right. I respect her a lot but I really cannot come to things with her. I never contacted my dad for very long, he only messages us once a year on our birthday, so I have not contacted him. I feel bad for my grandma, which she has to stay here and constantly get shouted at by her own daughter.


Sorry for my rant. I really really feel bad. I know I am not perfect, I make mistakes but I at least acknowledge my mistakes and try to be better, on the other hand, my mom never thinks she’s wrong. I just don’t know what to do. Maybe I should really just die like how she always says and fulfill her “wish”. I never really told my close friends about this situations over the years as I feel it is not necessary and they cannot really help other then comforting me which I am grateful for. What should I do? I think I really have a problem. I have not went to any therapy as my mom would just not go as she never thinks she is wrong. She expects me to apologize every time and I feel like shit as I am really tired now. I just don’t know what to do. I apologize for any spelling or grammatical error in this post. I am feeling really tired. This post is really bad and doesn’t include many other situations, I’m sorry for not including other things. I am really tired already..

1. Single sex schools 
a. Top schools are all single sex. People ask why there are so many NUS toilet filming and peeping Tom cases. Our kids are sexually repressed from a young age and imagine someone who is in an all male environment from ages 12-21 (including NS), boom, you’re bound to get at least a handful of sexually deprived predators in university. Many are not equipped with the social skills to deal with the opposite sex in a normal way. Which other developed countries have such an abundance of single sex elite schools? It’s such a backwards thing and needs to be addressed. And don’t even come kpkb about sap schools, sure there are some inequalities here and there but that is nothing compared to this nationwide gender disaster we have here. You just have to look at the Japanese and some of the weird sexual deviants they have out there to get a sense of the road we are headed down. 
If you want to talk elitism, you should abolish IP. What’s with the fact that the fate of your kid could be decided at primary school? How is that a fair opportunity for late bloomers? People who have the financial resources move close to pri schs with IP programmers all the way to jc, how is that not screwed up in every way? No wonder the rich get richer everyday. 

2. Possibility of tagging all citizens with tracker
Lanjiao, don’t even get me started on this. How is this not a violation of human rights? I see y’all complaining about not being able to visit family, but this tracker is on a whole new level. The fact that they would even have the balls to suggest this is parliament is shocking. What next, microchipping? Come on, I know gahmen likes to keep track of everyone’s academic record, medical records, personal information, and that gahmen scholars are watched even more closely  and bred like farm animals, but I truly did not see this one coming. It’s not just that this is a fundamental human rights issue worth reporting to the United Nations. The thing is, the more you track and farm your animals, the more useless your future leaders become.


3. NSFs can die for the country at 18, but cannot vote.
It’s time to re-examine this one. If you can sacrifice (and most of us men sacrificed at least 2 years of our lives) you should be given a say in who should govern the country. There is no way to argue around this, and no excuses. Either you change the voting age or your change the enlistment age. No double standards la lanjiao.

Overall, gahmen has done ok with handling covid. But it seems recently there have been a lot of inconsistencies that can be improved on. Either way, these points are valid, covid or not.

Well first of all, regarding that mask guideline thing. Early on in this covid fight, govt stance has been for the public not to wear a mask because the masks should go to medical personnel. I totally agree with it. But question is, if the government had a stockpile of reusable mask that is sufficient for everyone, why didn't they distribute it earlier, so people can decide for themselves if they want to wear it? I was wearing disposable surgical masks in the early stages because I was aware of the asymptomatic cases(from the news), but I stopped wearing them after I debated with a friend about how the masks should go to medical personnel. There is no way the govt doesn't know about the asymptomatic covid cases reported in China, and now they are reversing their stance on it?? This was always the reason why I wanted to wear mask in the first place. How can I practice social responsibility when I don't even know if I have covid, and I go to work as per normal, interact with my family and friends. LOL. And then come April and they panicked, and reversed the whole stance on wearing masks. But too late. 

Why do I say too late, because the covid cases are ald hidden in the community. Everyday we look at the news and see seemingly low number of  community cases, but the truth is, there are still asymptomatic cases which unknowingly is still passing the virus around. Nobody knows who they are, they don't know who they are. And now how are we gonna weed them out? Test the whole population? China, even till now they are still picking up asymptomatic cases today.

Look at Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, which geographically and economically is considered more closely linked to China, there are all living life as per normal. And look at Singapore. And we want to say sg ministers are deserving of their high pay because of their high calibre. LOL.

I admit that part of my frustration comes from when I had that mask debate with my friend, I was ridiculed. And now what, everyone is wearing a mask on the streets.

ho4tmc,1594307630,ho4tmc,27,,"Voting day is just around the corner and I have reached a quarter-life age to vote. As far as I know, I have no interest in politics. I do care about my country and want to contribute in ways that I can. But while everyone else on social media is caught up with their heated political discussions, I can't put my mind on what each political party is doing right now at all. In fact, I haven't been able to put my mind on anything lately. Forgive me as I could not be bothered with national politics when politics within my own house is already driving me crazy. As you know, charity begins at home. Then again the concept of home took me back to my college dissertation. Where I thought homesickness like all sickness would pass. Where home will always be somewhere I am not. 

This year, I came back and months flowed away like water in a river. January was daunting as I was devoid of my freedom. In February, I thought even though everything changed, the sun still shined the same. March was just another month of being a salaryman who never tried hard. April was the start of staying home. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and I have always wanted to come home when I was living abroad. I had missed Singapore terribly and this bittersweet fuzziness always kept me longing to come back. But since the day I came back, I might just have been dealing with a mental breakdown without realising it. 

There were a lot of hidden problems in this house I'm living that is not obvious to the eye. Before I returned to Singapore, my mom got a new domestic helper. I have never lived with a domestic helper my whole life but I have lived with flatmates of various nationalities when I was living abroad and we cleaned after ourselves and resolved whatever conflicts we had peacefully. I have also moved around amidst a housing crisis where I experienced living in houses with really bad living conditions. When coronavirus cases spiked in foreign worker dormitories, I felt so strongly that overcrowded spaces are inevitably breeding grounds for viruses let alone when hygiene gets neglects. Usually, when an owner doesn't occupy their property, they don't care about the living conditions inside. And occupants who don't own their living unit usually do not put in much effort to take care of it. and worse yet occupants have to overcrowd for economical reasons and that's how a living space gets deteriorated to unlivable. The spike in cases was unprecedented but the government did in an aspect neglect how the most vulnerable in society are able to cope with the virus outbreak. This time, I have been trying in vain to make this house that I have been living in throughout my growing years as livable as I could. I have tirelessly thrown out a ton of unneeded things in the house and cleaned off dust and mould from items that were piled up in a corner for the longest time. Still, any day, when I open the kitchen cupboard, the jars and containers would be smeared with a thick layer of oil. I don't know how to describe my situation but this combination of my mom and the domestic helper is putting me through hell. I have been trying to manage the house but my mom would confront me that I have no right to lecture her maid. Worse yet, my mom is a hoarder who also ordered a truckload of food to the house that she never got around finish consuming. Previously, I have already noticed the fridge to reak of a putrid smell and food items in the fridge are also haphazardly put with no space to spare. I have requested my mom and her helper to clean up the fridge many times but they never did. I have also realised that since months ago, an opened bottled drink, an opened yogurt tub would always turn bad after one or two days even though the expiry date is far away and I had my fair share of stomach problems from consuming food in the house. The interior of the fridge is also always wet and clammy and one day I discovered a stem of grapes in the fridge my mom had just purchased had hair growing all over them. I informed my mom and she got agitated and told me it's none of my business to meddle with her food and she would eat all the rotten grapes for all she cared. As I did not want food in the fridge to continue to be contaminated, I poured some white vinegar on different compartments in the fridge and it could have spilled onto some food items. I am no chemist but I'm sure having a little vinegar on food items is better than having microorganisms. I don't how this somehow got escalated that according to my mom, I deliberately poured water into the fridge to make the fridge seems like it had a problem to find unnecessary chore for her maid. Sometimes some of my mom and her domestic helper's actions would piss me off so much that I could not control my emotions and I did scream and cry like a baby. This has caused a particular neighbour to habitually call the police on me even though I was mostly screaming in the afternoon. The police officers are always quick to confront yet unwilling to read you like an open book. The last thing I want is for a police officer to take things at face value and condescendingly ask me to move out of my own house. But since the last time police came to my house, I have learned, like what Mr. Hiiragi taught his class in the movie Mr. Hiiragi’s Homeroom, to control my emotions and not act rashly.

I might have been living idealistically thinking 'trust' is implicit, unless otherwise proven, especially with immediately members living in the same house. I feel like I have trapped in a cycle of mental (self) torture and very out of touch with reality. I am writing this and just leaving it on the 'front page of the internet' so that, to my friends who have been asking me 'how are you', I could link them this if they want to know how I have really been. Sadly, I was just told that this is no longer my home and I might soon be uprooted from this hdb unit I grew up in.

A friend came to visit me and having a friend over kinda rescued me out of a vicious cycle of my own thoughts. When my friend was in my house and opened the fridge, he turned to me and said, ""your fridge smells like a rubbish dump.""

""My fridge is cursed.""

We realised we couldn't cook anything as most food, even though so much food, were rotten. Later that day we went out for a meal and my friend randomly said to me, ""do you know you smell a little like your fridge?"" My heart broke. I couldn't think of anything else except for that scene from Parasite. Then I just told my friend about how much of a Junji Ito fan I am as his comic makes us address our worse fears.

I'm not the most patriotic but I so badly want Singapore to be my home, inside out, like how it should have been. But then again, having a familiar place to call home will always be a luxury. Home will always be somewhere I am not.

I ask this because, with the SGUNTIED jobs that the government is providing, I feel that a large part of the people who are having a hard time considering is the fact that to change a career field and to start from square one, is a massive undertaking that requires a lot of thought and consideration.

I think it's something to think about, that while, yes, if you're really desperate and want to retain your current lifestyle, you'll probably take it in a heartbeat, but if COVID is gone right after you've finished your course, you'll gladly go back to your previous career field.

And it's also probably on a lot of people's minds, changing career and getting a lower pay (than before) after they've invested so much into uni education and etc.

Among many issues, Singapore has to take a harder look at our more than liberal immigration policies which brought in massive number foreign talents to the point where Singaporeans are at times discriminated in out own homelands. A rare first among first world nations.

But Lim Tean's irrationality approach to politics will only doom our nation.

He has blamed certain parties for wasting time reviewing CECA without uncovering the tradeoffs and the merits. Parties which proposed reviewing CECA were Progress Singapore Party, Red Dot United and Singapore Democratic Party.

Lastly, employing Singaporeans as HR managers does not stop the immigration issues Singaporeans are facing.  Decision to hire are mostly made by the hiring manager and senior management who frequently makes the final decision in employment and the mix.

My spouse has only has one parent left, who is uneducated, and has been plagued with health and mental issues over the years that we have been married. My spouse is the primary caretaker and her siblings contribute financially, but have more or less stopped visiting and acknowledging that my in-law exists due to issues of face where they are afraid that if their friends know what their parent has mental issues, it would bring shame upon them.

At this point, one of my spouse's sibling's children has a kid and my in-law has to this date, never met the great grand child and due to the COVID situation, probably never will before passing away. Most of my in-law's children and grandchildren have never visited during the many times of hospitalization.

My in-law has been a Buddhist her entire life time and her children consist of a mix of other religions. Due to differences in religion, one of my spouse's sibling has managed to convince my in-law to change religions, which in the face of impending death, is an extremely predatory move. This is not against the religion but on that particularly sibling as I have obvious doubts about any sort of filial piety.

My in-law seems to have no real understanding of what is required in this religious conversion, other than being convinced that there's no background nor learning requirements needed and that going to heaven is an assured thing, and that the funeral costs may be cheaper and doesn't seem to understand that their original death rite intentions are being undermined (which is to be interred next to their late partner and spending the afterlife together).

That particular sibling is most likely going to leave my spouse to handle things once they have accomplished their contribution of converting my in-law to their religion.

But that's not the point of this post, since this is a decision made by my in-law (who admittedly is easily swayed by the wishes of their children), but on the logistical aspects of it.

I would like advice on the following:

- What do we do with the deities and prayer gods in my in laws home? From my understanding, they need to be ""invited"" out of the home properly to the temples and the religion my in laws is converting to will not do this. Who do we contact for this? What sort of arrangements do we need to take?

- are prayer deities of other religions allowed to remain in the home? One of my spouse's sibling lives with my in law and has lots of statues of deities of the Thai monks and gods. What is the process for these?

- are there things that should be avoided during this process? There's a high chance that priests of the new religion will be invited to the home soon to ""completed"" the conversion and having experienced some unnatural things when I was in NS, I am extremely reluctant to let them handle this and would prefer that the respective priests from the different religions handle this properly.

- how does this affect funeral interment arrangements? From what I understand, there is already a niche in place, but with the religion change, can my in-law still be interred there? This is in mandai collabarium. Who do we reach out to on this?

- if we made funeral arrangements to do it in one religion, logistically is this possible to change at the last minute (assuming my in-law changes their mind before they pass)

- In the event that my in-law changes their mind, can any of the above even be reversed? 

This discussion has occurred multiple times whenever that particular sibling of my spouse shows up, but my in-law seems determined to go thru this time round and we decided to respect the decision, whatever it may be.

Any help and advice is appreciated and apologies if the post seems a bit incoherent.

A bit of oil left and I don't have any noodles left (i dont eat instant noodles, referring to the healthier versions)  to the  When the news broke near 12am, I got a big shock. When pictures of people queuing starts flooding my social media, I got out of my bed and head down to the nearest 24hrs supermarket to buy my eggs, cereal, bee hoon, frozen meat and cooking oil. I initially do not understand why would people panic buy in the first wave, but I think I do now. 

**Some people have elderly parents to take care of at home** (persons behind me in the queue)

If the borders with Malaysia are gonna be shut off tomorrow, with no Malaysians getting out or no foreigners coming in, shit is definitely going to hit the fan. A lot of our food services and retail relies on Malaysian employees, expect many services to be disrupted. A couple I talked to have elderly parents to care for and children at home. They brought frozen minced meat to cook porridge for their elderly parents, packs of cereal for their kids, some canned food, eggs and spices. They share with me their concerns on how many food services are reliant solely on Malaysian exports, and how this poses a lot of uncertainty on them being able to buy takeout food in the future (even if there is Singaporean workers around). Obviously their parents shouldn't eat fast food, that's why they are buying minced meat now. 

**Some of the people in the queue are Malaysians. Yes the Covid-19 situation gave us a reverse Uno card** (person in front of me in the queue)

From what I heard, supermakets in Malaysia are completely wiped off and wet markets are selling the vegetables at ridiculously high prices. In face of the coming lockdown, Malaysians NEED to stock up on food. So some of them recruited the help of their Malaysian friends/relatives to buy food for them in Singapore to be brought back into Malaysia. Instead of Singaporeans going to Johore for groceries, Malaysians are now in the queue to buy food to be brought back into Malaysia. Goes to show how back the situation is.    

Another thing I heard was the criticism of Minister Chua Chan Sing for being out of touch. It was said that since he doesn't go for grocery shopping himself, and would stay safe in the event of crazy inflation (it is def on the tables now seeing how many countries are going on lockdown with the economy crashing around us), he doesn't understand why would Singaporeans panic buy now. Yes, we have prepared for the event that there's supplies disruption from Malaysia, but what if everything happens at once with all the countries we are involved in? I do feel for the couple and their elderly parents. 

**Personal thoughts**

Some people have legitimate reasons for buying. Like the Malaysian in front of me, and the couple behind me. I may sound like the unreasonable person here....but I buy (just enough for me, not carts full) because I am afraid that if I go shopping tonight there would be no more eggs or oil left for me.

fo0afi,1585031041,fo0afi,28,,"Hello there, these are just my honest opinions. Let me know what you think. May suggest these to the developers at TraceTogether.

- Work together with google (Specifically the Google Maps Team) so as to ensure the app can run in the background. As of right now, google already tracks your location and honestly during a pandemic like this, we could use that data for the greater good. Maybe have a feature that allows you to turn off and on location services with a click of a button (there is an option within Settings but it is abit inconvenient)

- Work together with Private Hire apps. When boarding a Grab, Gojek, Tada or via the ComfortDelGro app, make use of the feature that allows the TraceTogether App to access the trip history. 

- Work together with SMRT. SMRT tracks your trip history (Ez-link card) and time stamps. Train stations are hotspots (touch wood) if this disease has a sudden boom in infection rates. Maybe even create an app to see your travel history without going to the MRT station.

- Get volunteers/developers from companies that have laid off due to current economic downturn.

- Offer rewards for enabling TraceTogether features on apps. ComfortDelGro gives $2 discount for flag down if you use a debit card to pay, which allows for more efficient contact tracing.

- Have a main page that displays all previous case locations. 

Other measures that can be taken that I feel can be implemented:

Instead of usual product advertisements,  have advertisements for this app. I truly believe this app can be a game changer.

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 was passed in Parliament and assented to by the President today.

You can look at the [act here](http://www.egazette.com.sg/pdf.aspx?ct=as&amp;yr=2020&amp;filename=20acts13.pdf). (Note: this link will become invalid in a few days, since things become unavailable from the free eGazette after a few days.) It should be available on Singapore Statutes Online soon.

This Act does quite a few things, but one of the things it does is _give power_ to the Minister for Health to order (via a _control order_) people to stay at a place (i.e. stay home), close premises or facilities, and restrict gatherings, etc., as needed, _to control the incidence or transmission of COVID-19_.

This **power** lasts for a year. (Of course, the act could be repealed before that, if the epidemic/pandemic ends.)

Now, a _control order_ that puts into place the restrictions that were announced last Friday was also issued today using the powers given to the Minister for Health. You can look at that [here](http://www.egazette.com.sg/pdf.aspx?ct=sls&amp;yr=2020&amp;filename=20sls254.pdf). (Again, this link will become invalid in a few days. It should by then be available on SSO.)

So please. **Stop fear-mongering about 6 months.**

 I'm a Secondary 3 student taking combined science and I'm in a Students' Council and also in a UG. At the start of this year, I was already pretty bummed out about not getting double sciences due to a lack of effort last year. I was prepared to actually give my all and try my best to get into a better class so that my academics wouldn't be lacking behind. I'll admit that there was a lot of procrastination on my part about the whole studying thing but I still pushed myself to at least finish every piece of homework assigned. It wasn't easy to focus in class since half of my classmates were honestly only there to play around. A lot of valuable time was thrown out the window just to scold some people. Now, obviously this is inevitable and happens to any class, so I didn't see it as a problem. So the first quarter of the year was pretty much spent trying to listen in class as much as I could while also having to choose between becoming a candidate for Council President or the head of my UG. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to when HBL started, I was initially relieved as I was pretty stressed out about the workload and pressure from CCA. At this point I had already finished my UG's leadership camp and I was looking forward to taking over the unit. I had assumed that HBL would only last until May so I would have had plenty of time for CCA. I was also quite worried at the same time about studies as I wasn't used to having so much free time after school ended. Now, after 2 whole weeks, I'm feeling lost and angry. My online lessons are wasted by teachers constantly having to kick out ""impostors"" while threatening but never actually reporting it(for some unknown reason). I can hardly learn anything useful while this shit keeps going on. My classmates and I all know who invited them in, but no one has solid proof. So much lesson time is spent on fixing technical issues and other pointless stuff. I just feel so lost when I think about the topics I might be missing out on. About CCA, if you were once from a UG, you might understand how I feel right now. I've been appointed as the head, yet there's essentially nothing I can do right now. I have many ideas that I want to try out to improve trainings as a whole, and I just want so badly for a training right now. Two years spent in a UG with close to no chances for me to experience leadership. And judging by the current situation, I'm either going to have very little time to actually try out what a cadet leader does during training, or I won't even have a chance to. This annoys and frustrates me to no end. The fact that I might not even be able to be a leader. After two years of enduring physical and mental pain. After all I've done to persuade myself from leaving. All for naught. Every time CCA comes to mind, I feel useless; unable to do anything. I feel helpless and lost; with nowhere to go. I want to achieve something by the time I graduate, something that can improve and motivate people. But I can't. I want to give my all and focus on studies, but I also can't.

iln28z,1599108669,iln28z,29,,"Just my thoughts on a topic often discussed on this subreddit. My personal views, please don't hate on me if you disagree.

Recently, xenophobia in Singapore has begun to take centre-stage, as the Covid-19 pandemic threatens livelihoods, causing much anxiety and frustration to be directed towards foreign expatriates working in Singapore. Certainly, an open economy such as Singapore cannot afford to allow xenophobic sentiments to run rampant, even as the government needs to recognise the importance of protecting the livelihoods of Singaporeans. And of course, while legitimate concerns on Singapore's foreign workforce must be heard, racist remarks of any kind need to be swiftly condemned. Yet, this is not the topic I will be discussing today.

Quite contrary to the often borderline xenophobic discussions online centred around the jobs market in Singapore, there is a separate strain of xeno""philia"" when it comes to educational discourse, both online and offline. The key tenet of such perspectives is the idea that the Singaporean educational system is somehow grossly inferior in equipping graduates with ""real-world"" skills, the ability for independent thought, and general creativity and entrepreneurship, relative to a caricatured picture of ""overseas"" ""Western"" education. The alleged shortcomings of the Singaporean education system, often claimed to be both severe and hopelessly entrenched, is blamed for a range of social phenomena, ranging from employers' complaints of Singaporean workers, entitled behaviour among young Singaporeans, governmental inefficiencies, and even the PAP's continued large electoral mandate. 

While I believe that the Singaporean educational system has areas where improvements can be made, I disagree with the above characterisation of our education system. Instead, I believe that the Singapore education system does equip graduates with real-world skills, and does not stifle creativity or independent thought in the way alleged by many commentators.

Perhaps the best way to rebut the detractors of Singapore's education system would be a clear, objective description of Singapore's educational scene today. Singapore's educational landscape is increasingly diverse, with various tracks afforded to students of varying inclinations. From the technical track offered by ITE and vocational schools, to polytechnic education which focuses heavily on industry problem solving, and of course to the autonomous universities, which train specialist degree-holders in each field. Even among the autonomous universities, we see new schools like SUTD which focus on a more interactive learning experience and the marrying of engineering with design principles. Even our old, venerable universities are rolling out new programmes to equip students with interdisciplinary skills required in the modern workplace, such as the Renaissance Engineering programme offered by NTU and the Design and Innovation Programme offered by NUS. Even in the lower levels of education, such as secondary school, the CCA options for students are becoming increasingly varied, including CCAs which teach students IT and infocomm skills, drama and speech delivery, even programming and robotics. This is not to mention the range of workshops and events organised by both private and government organisations to give students a more varied educational experience in school.

One frequent gripe about Singapore's education system is that it is centred around rote-learning, examinations and knowledge regurgitation. While that may be true in the past, I believe this is not reflective of the present situation. With the Ministry of Education implementing the ""teach less, learn more"" idea in schools, syllabuses at all levels have been reduced in breadth and coverage, while questions are being set to test more in-depth understanding as well as application of knowledge in real-world scenarios. This can be seen in the advent of application-based and data-response questions in science exam papers, from primary school through junior college. While it may be true that some teachers are still encouraging a rote-learning response to such questions, it is an inevitable fact that no matter how ""creative"" the questions are, there will still be those who will try to ""game"" the system by proposing ""one-size-fit-all"" rote-learning techniques. But suffice it to say that such strategies are now much less useful than in the past.

As for examinations, I believe that the preservation of national examinations are a necessary evil to allow for a fairer playing ground for less privileged students. There are many comments among students in online forums about how students in less ""elite"" junior colleges suffer when it comes to H1 Project Work, as the disparity in resources disadvantages these students. Such concerns should be heeded as a warning bell for those proposing more ""project-based"" assessments in national examinations. While there will still be an unfair playing ground in pen-and-paper examinations, I would say that it is still more meritocratic, as it is still very possible for a hard-working, talented student to do well despite an underprivileged background. As for scrapping the national examinations altogether, the recent fiasco in the UK should be a cautionary tale for us. Without national examinations, imagine a student graduating with straight As from a neighbourhood school, versus a student graduating with straight As from an elite school. The latter will most likely be preferred by employers and higher educational institutes, which is grossly unfair to the former, who may be equally if not more talented.

With that being said, students with a greater inclination for project-based tasks still have opportunities at a later stage, where education in polytechnics, or in an IB programme school, may be the suitable path for them. Our education system allows for that flexibility. Students from polytechnics and IB schools still have good opportunities to enter into local autonomous universities to further their education.

Another convincing argument against a pessimistic, cynical view of the Singaporean education system would be that if our education system is so much more inferior than that in ""western"" countries, why is it that there is an extraordinarily large number of successful Singaporean students in overseas top universities, especially remarkable considering our small population? Most of these students grew up in Singapore, and underwent the Singaporean education system from primary school through junior college. If our education system was so ineffective, even detrimental to students, why is it that these students still succeed when they go to overseas institutions? This indicates that even in the worst-case, the problems in our education system is not as pervasive and significant as detractors claim. In fact, given that we are sending a disproportionate number of students to top universities in the ""West"", I would actually claim that our educational system is in no way inferior to ""western"" educational systems.

And lastly, on global rankings, Singaporean school students score consistently high on global educational rankings like PISA, and Singaporean universities are ranked as among the top in the world. All these rankings are devised by ""Western"" educators. Certainly it seems like the ""superior"" ""Western"" educators don't have such a dim view of our education system!

With all that being said, I would still be among the first to agree that our education system needs to constantly improve. In my opinion, one area that can be improved is introducing a more discursive educational style in secondary school, especially when it comes to the humanities. Often, in order to prepare students for the national examinations, the humanities subjects in secondary schools are taught in a way that is more prescriptive rather than allowing for opportunities for discussions. In my opinion, there are two reasons for this: 1. Relatively simpler questions which allow for rote-learning to be fairly effective, and 2. the less developed maturity of thought possessed by secondary school students, leading teachers to view it as better to give them essays to memorise than to allow them to construct their own (inadequate) answers. These two reasons means this problem is difficult to handle. On one hand, the less developed maturity of secondary school students when it comes to intellectual thinking means that questions cannot be set too difficult. Yet easier questions open up the possibility of regurgitated answers scoring highly. Can we then blame well-meaning teachers for trying to get their students to memorise model essays? The problem is far more complex and nuanced than most recognise, and require careful thought and research by seasoned educators.

Concluding, the Singaporean education system has definitely much room for improvement, but I believe that the doom-and-gloom, cynical description of many online commentators is divorced from the true reality of the situation. An objective, careful observer of our education system would conclude that it is remarkably diverse, well-constructed and effective, while still acknowledging areas where change for the better can occur. I believe that this is the realistic position to take, and the correct one if we were to build upon our successes and continue to make education of the next generation of Singaporeans our priority.",,"Rethinking the xeno""philia"" in discussions on Singapore's education system",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iln28z/rethinking_the_xenophilia_in_discussions_on/

Indonesian Ministry of Health

&gt; The Indonesian IHR National Focal Point, an official from the Indonesian Health Ministry, has acknowledged receipt of all the correspondences on these cases sent by Singapore’s IHR National Focal Point, added the ministry.

 Was it made up by the Jakarta Post, or was the Singaporean Embassy speaking without thinking  At this moment in many countries non-health officials (even health officials) make statements that misinformed.. But I am more likely to believe the Jakarta Post is making stuff up.

I don't think for one minute the Singaporean Government, especially a Ministry like the Ministry of Health would act in such a petty manner and violate an international treaty.

The motto of the Jakarta Post is ""Always Bold, Always Independent"",  You can see from this statement, their objective isn't objectivity, so even by Indonesian standards their reporting standards are low.  Its target market is expats in Jakarta, many of whom don't read Indonesian. They play to this expat crowd.. Unfortunately, Its the primary source of many non-Indonesian speaking foreign reporters.

We have committed/spent around $100 billion in our Covid-19 response, which is the same as our commited climate change spending over the next 100 years. Our GDP growth forecast for this year goes down every few months. We have lost status internationally after squandering our acclaimed and swift early response to the crisis, like our ban from travel to the EU. 

Where would we be today if we spent a lot of money and resources early enough to make a big difference? Let's start with $1 billion.

What if we spent $1 billion on migrant workers dorms from 2015-2019 to upgrade them to the new proposed standards, with subsidised all in one services and groceries so they don't have to go out and mingle so much during off days?

What if we spent $2 billion by end Feb to panic import mask making assembly lines and ordered our chemical industry to focus all resources on producing test reagent chemicals? 

What if we spent $8 billion by end Mar to continue previous efforts, mass import rPCR equipment, paid testing technicians $3k like swabbers, stopped education for all students able to be covid lab tech and compensated them, and rush built testing facilities? 

And to attract staff with medical training to come back after intense training by using very attractive salaries and benefits, and paid acute and community hospital aides $2.5k for extended afternoon shift so nurses can focus on nursing instead of feeding and toileting? 

The dorm situation is simply unforgivable. It is the job of civil servants to take care of black swan scenarios, like the pandemic. Even if we had to spend $1 billion earlier to bring up the standards to the new ones, there would probably still be a CB at some point. But we would have bought a lot of time, and the numbers would have been smaller. 

If we spent $5 billion in Feb, or $10 billion in Mar by solving the migrant worker problem ASAP by housing them in hotels and unoccupied structures, the result could be just as good.

Guess what is the school going to do due to MOE uping measures against coronavirus?

1. No physical contact. Orientation group leaders don't touch the new JC1.

2. Cancelation of mass games and mass dances. Basically any activities that has a big concentration of people.

3. No lunch or dinner together in school. Go home and eat.

This is where the rant begins and with current info I have, these measures are rather ineffective and simply put, dumb.

Firstly, what if someone injure themselves, are you not going to help them because physical contact prohibited? When you are moving from locations to locations with a lot of people, chances of accidentally touching people is very high.

Secondly, without having meals or mass activities, how is the JC1 cohort going ro bond with each other and make friends? Their orientation experience is practically ruined. They might as well not come to school or cancel orientation all together because they probably come to school just for admin talks and information on subjects. These information can be disseminated online and let these JC1 students access on school website.

These measures are not practical. What should be done or could be done is to ensure the JC1

1. Take temperature every morning.
2. Do not come to school if there are any signs of symptoms.
3. Wash hands or use hand sanitizer before every activities.
4. Do not touch anyone or your own face.

Preventive measures should be implemented properly and not in such an extreme manner. I understand how contagious Wu Han is, but suitable measures should be taken and not just go nuclear. I have no problems if these measures are reasonable. This wastes the efforts and logistics put in by the people planning orientation and I truly feel bad for them.

Please share this note so that we can get answers and actions that can possibly keep the many families that went to Chingay safe - or give them peace of mind that this is being handled with the seriousness and followup that it needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Background of Case 44: [MOH | News Highlights](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/one-more-case-discharged-two-new-cases-of-novel-coronavirus-infection-confirmed-10feb?fbclid=IwAR1CR_x95HFInqTkdxCaFC-eMcmHnIa6POz3jBKaDUtZZuwjxZ0-1eHNzPk)  
 Case 44 is a 37 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH).He reported onset of symptoms on 31 January, and had sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic on 2 February. He went to KTPH on 6 February where he was immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on 9 February afternoon.Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at Certis Cisco Centre (20 Jalan Afifi), and had been on duty at Chingay 2020. Prior to onset of symptoms, he had served Quarantine Orders on two individuals from Wuhan who were subsequently tested positive for 2019-nCoV. He had not served any Quarantine Order after onset of symptoms. He stays at Sembawang Drive.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few hard questions today about CISCO and MOH’s handling of nCOV case 44

1. What biosafety measures and instructions are CISCO staff taking before, during and after serving the quarantine orders?
2. What kind of interaction did the CISCO officer have with the 2 patients?
3. Why was the CISCO officer not put in quarantine from their families or on restricted duties after working with potentially infected patients?
4. Whose idea at CISCO was it to place a person who was in relatively close contact - explaining the quarantine order - and then staffing one of the biggest public events?
5. Where areas and locations was the officer positioned while on duty at Chingay?
6. Should members of the public have contracted the nCov at Chingay, what measures are available to compensate them? Save for CISCO knowingly or negligently placing on duty a staff with exposure to nCOV at a large community event, thousands of members of the public would not have been exposed to this.
7. How many other CISCO officers are in similar circumstances of having served quarantine orders and then performed duties in crowds? What has been done to monitor or quarantine them?
8. Are there any other people served with quarantine orders that may have been infected by such CISCO officers?
9. What steps are CISCO amd MOH taking to prevent a repeat of this incident?
10. Should these duties of serving quarantine orders be better performed by SAF bio-chemical defense units?",,"Hard questions about CISCO, nCOV and Chingay",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f1savg/hard_questions_about_cisco_ncov_and_chingay/

Moved to Singapore end of Jan. Got a great job, found an apt I liked. Then the world flipped upside down. 

Back in the US, my wife’s family’s house burnt down, destroying all our belongings. My wife returned to help her parents for a while. 

Now, she can’t return to Singapore due to the entry restrictions with COVID, that will last who knows how long. 

I’m unable to even go visit her, as I would also not be able to return, putting my employment in jeopardy. 

My employer has only guaranteed salaries through May. If I am laid off in Singapore, I’m not eligible for US benefits for the unemployed. I’m also ineligible for any support for Singaporeans, and rightfully so. 

My company can transfer me to the US office so that if (when?) layoffs come I’m laid off there and can collect benefits. I’m planning to move back to the US where we have an option to live rent-free. 

However I need to break my tenancy agreement here. 

LL is asking for 4 MOs rent and forfeit security deposit. (~$15k)

Is there any sense of Force Majuere or Act of God governing TAs?  Any type of tenant protection other than the “get out”clause? There isn’t one in my agreement and even if so, it would not have taken effect (3 MOs into 1 yr lease). 

Are there any tenants rights groups in Sing worth contacting?  

What are the ramifications of simply bailing on the lease? 

I’d appreciate any and all guidance.

I've been bored of my job for a while, planned to find a new job after this year CNY but then covid came around. I've seen quite a few schemes and there is this fintech one, where it's school for 2 months then OJT for 9-12 months and there is a monthly stipend. Thinking this is an sgunited scheme so the stipend is probably 1.2k which isn't much compared to my current salary.

 My current job is while still in tech, more on the paperwork side and I'm kind of bored of it. I am in charge of my team and getting a salary review (most likely pay raise) this month. When applying jobs, it seems like the more technical roles want some experience which I don't have any. I took some courses in nus computing so i know some basics but didn't really do projects. My main purpose for wanting to go for this is: 

- fintech is a big and expanding industry, so future payscale would potentially a lot higher than the more administrative role that I'm currently doing
- more potential job fulfilment rather than pushing papers/emails around
-im not being paid a lot if I can find a good job in fintech, it would definitely be worth it. 
- it's an easy way to get experience in a bigger company

Cons:
- leaving a stable job for traineeship with no job guarantee after a 9-12 mth internship
- being broke for a year
-its going to be a struggle bus during the learning/traineeship period but I'm prepared (I think)
- what if I'm not good enough to be a developer role/I end up in PM/PL role which I already have the opportunity to do in my current company

Personally, I think this is exciting as I've enjoyed the original immensely, as well as the sequel (despite the grotesquely obvious product placement).

That said, I'm hoping that this one's going to be almost 2 hour long as well - but what I really hope is that Jack Neo would tone down the product placement, find a way to integrate the products in the background rather than putting them in the fore. Can't say I blame Jack Neo, since the producer and the sponsors likely have a part to play in it as well. When will they learn that obvious product placement actually hurts them?

Anyway, I don't want this to devolve into a rant, so let's move on. According to the news source, the script was written largely during Singapore's own lockdown (aka Circuit Breaker), so this makes me wonder if the story would have something to do with COVID-19 as well. It makes a lot of sense, since job loss is a huge problem during this crisis as it was during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis that inspired Money No Enough 1. I think it'd be interesting how they'd try to put that in the plot.

That's one way to reinvent the formula I guess. I really don't want to see a rehash of the first or second movie. Thankfully, the second movie isn't just a shot-for-shot remake of the first, which is what made it work for me.

Overnight in Asia, we hosted a call with Professor John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at The University of Hong Kong and expert on coronaviruses. He was a key member of the research team at The University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He has been studying coronaviruses for 25 years. Below are my notes transcribing the call. 

Quick summary: 

Look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it’s below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold which kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands.
 
My notes from the call below:
 
Q&amp;A Session with Professor Nicholls:
 
What is the actual scale of the outbreak? How much larger is it compared to the official “confirmed” cases?
 
People are saying a 2.2 to 2.4% fatality rate total. However recent information is very worthy - if you look at the cases outside of China the mortality rate is &lt;1%. [Only 2 fatalities outside of mainland China]. Two potential reasons: 1) either China’s healthcare isn’t as good – that’s probably not the case, 2) What is probably right is that just as with SARS there’s probably much stricter guidelines in mainland China for a case to be considered positive. So the 20,000 cases in China is probably only the severe cases; the folks that actually went to the hospital and got tested. The Chinese healthcare system is very overwhelmed with all the tests going through. So my thinking is this is actually not as severe a disease as is being suggested. The fatality rate is probably only 0.8%-1%. There’s a vast underreporting of cases in China. Compared to SARS and MERS we are talking about a coronavirus that has a mortality rate of 8 to 10 times less deadly to SARS to MERS. So a correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a severe cold. Basically, this is a severe form of the cold.
 
You mentioned a shortage of testing kit can you talk more about that?
 
There are two ways to detect a virus: 1) Through the genetic material – DNA or RNA or, 2) to detect the protein of the virus. The rapid tests used in a doctors’ labs look at the protein. The problem with that is that you need an antibody to pick it up. And it takes 8-12 weeks to make commercial antibodies. So right now for the diagnostics tests they are using PCR which give you a turnaround in 1-2 hours. But then you need to run a machine and run 96 runs in 1 hour but then you have to a batch of samples so there’s another delay of 5-6 hours for patient presentation. So that will lead to some problems you can’t turnaround in 5-10 mins which is what you want when a patient shows up to the emergency room. Because right now you also have influenza going around so what you want is to be able to rule out influenza so you can treat the patients correctly for coronavirus. So that may be why they missed some of the earlier cases.
 
Your colleague at HKU estimated that the size of the infected population on Jan 25th was 75K with a doubling time of 6.4 days. So by Feb first we would have 150k infected. How accurate do you think these models are and how accurate have they been in the past?
 
Those figures did not take into account restriction on travel, quarantine etc. These reports are likely on the high side. This is not taking into account social distancing. Historically, these models have not been all that accurate.
 
When do you think this thing will peak?

Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity. To make you guys really worried. A coronavirus can survive on a stainless steel surface for 36 hours. It hangs around for quite a bit.
 
Sunlight will cut the virus ability to grow in half so the half-life will be 2.5 mins and in the dark it’s about 13 mins to 20 mins. Sunlight is really good at killing viruses. That’s why I believe that Australia and the southern hemisphere will not see any great infections rates because they have lots of sunlight and they are in the middle of summer. And Wuhan and Beijing is still cold which is why there is high infection rates.
 
In regards to temperature, the virus can remain intact at 4 degrees or 10 degrees for a longer period of time. But at 30 degrees then you get inactivation. And high humidity the virus doesn’t like it either. That is why I think SARS stopped around May and June in 2003 – that’s when there’s more sunlight and more humidity. The environment is a crucial factor. The environment will be unfavourable for growth around May. The evidence is to look at the common cold – it’s always during winter. So the natural environment will not be favourable in Asia in about May.
 
The second factor is that of personal contact. With SARS once it was discovered that the virus was spread through the fecal oral route, there was much less emphasis on the masks, and far more emphasis on disinfection and washing hands. HK has far more cleanliness (than China) and they are very aware of social hygiene. And other countries will be more aware of the social hygiene (than China). So in those countries you should see less outbreaks and spreading. A couple days ago the fecal-oral route of transmission was confirmed in Shenzhen. In China, most of the latrines are open-  there’s more chance of phermites (?) being spread. But in other countries the sanitations systems tends to closed. My personal view is that this will be a bad cold and it will all be over by May.
 
People talk about the vaccine and this is the big problem that people get from movies. Where in the movie they come out with a vaccine and then three days later it’s all over the world and everybody is saved. In reality this does not happen because for a vaccine you need to go through clinical trials – is it safe and will it work. The last thing you want to do is rush a vaccine too early. If you get any severe reactions, then the anti-vaxxer will just say “I told you so”. You are talking about a working vaccine in 1 to 2 years. With SARS, in 6 months the virus was all gone and it pretty much never came back. SARS pretty much found a sweet spot of the perfect environment to develop and hasn’t come back. So no pharmaceutical company will spend millions and millions to develop a vaccine for something which may never come back. It is Hollywood to think that vaccines will save the world. The social conditions are what will control the virus – the cleaning of hands, isolating sick people etc…
 
What do we know about the transmission rate? It’s been estimated around 2.2 to 2.68. What percent of the patients are transmitting while being asymptomatic?
 
This is a big problem when you talk about asymptomatic that means you have a good diagnostic test- where you can say they are asymptomatic (which we don’t have with this virus).
 
We actually looked at this with MERS where people were saying it had a high fatality. We went to camel abattoirs and took serums from the abattoir workers and found that quite a few had low infections with no symptoms. This is what should have been done at the initial stages at the seafood market. But to do that you need a good diagnostic test. A good diagnostic test is necessary to determine to the transmission rate. Now we have normal human airways and we can now look at how long it takes the virus to replicate in that environment. And that will be very useful to determine those who are asymptomatic carriers.
 
Any sense of whether the estimates of the reproductive number the R0 of 2.5 or 2.7.  Do you think that is high or low. What does that mean?
 
Measles was about 10-15 and influenza is just below 2. I think it’s about 2.2 as it’s being transmitted within the community.
 
Have we seen any super spreaders? We saw that with SARS and MERS.
 
There’s talk about that but the epidemiologists are still overwhelmed so no clear answer. But I don’t think there are any super spreaders.
 
What is the percentage of people transmitting the virus while being asymptomatic?
 
Unlike SARS, patients were symptomatic at about day 5, some of these cases may be asymptomatic until about day 7. That’s based on the first publications. Asymptomatic is probably the first 5 days.
 
There’s a paper published looking a familial cluster with a boy who was shredding the virus and he was asymptomatic.
 
That’s something about kids and we saw this with SARS. Very few kids had very severe disease. We are trying to determine if this is a virus which we call low (unintelligible) kind of inducer or high (unintelligible) kind of inducer.  SARS is high [unintelligible] kind of inducer. This means that when it infects the lower part of the lung, the body develops a very severe reaction against it and leads to lots of inflation and scarring. In SARS what we found is that after the first 10 to 15 days it wasn’t the virus killing the patients it was the body’s reaction.
 
We are doing testing on this now. Is this virus in the MERS or SARS kind picture or is this the other type of virus which is a milder coronavirus like the NL63 or the 229. I think this will be a mild (unintelligible) kind inducer.
 
Case fatality is about 2.5% or so? Do you expect this to change over time? And are you seeing any difference among the young population and older population in terms or mortality rate?

SARS went really for people in their 30 or 50 years. And MERS on the other hand basically is if you have co-morbidity – try and find somebody in the middle east who does not smoke or does not have high blood pressure etc.. The data coming out of China seems to indicate that it’s those with the co-morbidity are most at risk. For the seasonal influenza that’s also what we find. It’s the people with the co-morbidity that have the increase mortality rate.  Having said that there’s a guy in the Philippines who died in his mid-30.
 
I think this looks more like the seasonal influenza where those who die have to co-morbidity.  Now that we have better case control definitions outside of mainland China, we will get a true assessment of the fatality rate. I would now put it at about 0.8% to 1%.  When you look at all the death reports – separate out the deaths from mainland China and outside China.
 
Mortality rate in China – is much higher? Why?
 
Its related to the environment. In the high income countries you don’t have as high a population density, higher level of environment control and hygiene. In Indonesia – it’s unlikely to spread much as it’s very hot and humid. Would this virus move to Africa? I think that’s unlikely – too hot there’s not a lot of travel there. Europe – possibility higher transmission but environmental care is higher.
 
At this stage it’s a really bad cold which can cause problems in people. People are talking about the “lethal virus” but seasonal influenza can cause deaths in elderly but we don’t call that “the lethal influenza”.
 
There’s news reports that antivirals are being used and that it’s working what are your thoughts on that?
 
With SARS it didn’t seem to work at all with the commercially available antivirals. But there seems to be good effects with the case in Washington with the Gilead agent. And it sounds like China will be using it.
 
Interferon works and it has quite a bit of benefit.
 
The problem with the antivirals – because the virus has different ways of replicating within the cell, finding a nice common target has been difficult. But the Gilead agent appears to me to be very promising. We now have the virus growing in our labs/cultures so can now test it to see what will work and not work.
 
Would the opening of the hospitals in China change anything?
What we found with SARS in HK was that a contributing factor to the spread was the overwhelming of the HK healthcare system. Hospitals and doctors were overwhelmed. When China built these Wuhan hospitals – it’s to take the work load off the staff which is likely exhausted.  
 
In HK with SARS we found quite a lot of infection of healthcare workers as they are close and doing invasive procedures. But this time around there is not much evidence of the healthcare workers getting sick or dying (but maybe China is not reporting it) so this may suggest that I think it is not being spread by close aerosol contact but more by the fecal-oral route or with droplets. So it will not be as contagious within hospitals. So getting the two hospitals built it will take a lot of the work load off the other hospitals so it should be a big benefit.
 
The recovery rate now higher than the deaths rate? Thoughts on that?
What we found is that in HK with SARS we didn’t know how long to treat a patient for. Now in China they are using the SARS model but treating patients for shorter time periods so that they don’t get the secondary problems that they did with Sars. Getting actual data on recovery from the mainland is still a bit of a challenge.
 
I’d consider a patient recovered if he’s been discharged. The problem is that with SARS, there were quite a bit of people where the steroid were very beneficial to treat the acute stage and we didn’t know how long the virus would live for so we kept them on the steroids for a long period of time and they came out with all sorts of secondary problems due to the immunosuppression.
 
I haven’t seen any data on the quality of life of those who have been discharged.
 
Evidence of E-coli?
Secondary infection are most likely the cause of deaths of the patients in the Philippines and HK.
 
What does it mean for a patient to have recovered?
That means the patient has been discharged from the hospital. That’s the criteria for Hong Kong. But there’s no good data or guidelines on this.
 
What is the probability that this will be contained and eradicated or will it be endemic in the human population?
If it is like SARS it will not be endemic. It most likely will be a hit and run just like SARS. People talk about mutation but what we found with SARS was that there was no mutation and we have been tracking MERS and we have not seen any severe mutation. This is unlike the common coronavirus which when they replicate they don’t have a ”spell check” so they mutate. So if this virus follows the same path as SARS or MERS it won’t mutate.  This will not be endemic. I think it will burn itself out in about 6 months.
 
Does mortality rate or fatality rate typically increase over time? That was apparently the case with SARS. 
With SARS we didn’t know how long the virus was alive for. So with SARS in the later stages people were not dying of SARS but of the complications of SARS which is why the mortality rate increased. But now people are much more aware of the dangers of over immunosuppression. So the death rate shouldn’t be more severe. Especially with the new hospitals being established which should take some of the workload off of the healthcare workers from Wuhan.
 
If we look at the serious cases being reported it’s about 13% of the total cases being reported. If we assume a 50% mortality rate for the severe cases than we are looking at a mortality rate of 5-6%. Is that a fair assumption?

In Hubei, the milder cases are not making it to the hospital. Because they are so overwhelmed that milder cases are being sent away. So that’s why it’s important not to look at the mortality rate in Wuhan but to look at the mortality rate in Shanghai or Shenzhen or outside of Wuhan. It’s very important to dissect it out.
 
Would it be too early to make conclusion outside of Wuhan? It’s still really early days outside of Wuhan? Are we making assumption with very little data and very early data?

That’s all the data we have to work with. When you are dealing with an epidemic at the early stages – there’s such a variable. But now for political reason people are far more aware of the virus so it won’t be as epidemic as it was early on. There’s far more awareness and controlled environment and changes in social behaviour. Which I’m not sure is taken into account in the models. So it should spread far less outside of Wuhan.",,CLSA Conference call with coronavirus expert,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f06uuc/clsa_conference_call_with_coronavirus_expert/

So, in the spirit of some good old political speculation 

\- the Corona virus situation is likely to benefit the PAP massively. They will probably be aiming to get at least 75% of the total vote (similar to post 9-11). Issues like POFMA are currently too old and/or esoteric to make much of a difference.

\- the WP has some viable strategies, but the best I think would be to position themselves as enabling PAP to implement good policies (e.g. we complained so much in Parliament until the PAP did something). To this end, the WP does has some examples of initiatives that they first raised in Parliament which then went on to become good policies. However, this approach is a bit too subtle and nuanced, and so I think the WP will supplement this with more populist approaches - either tastefully whack LHL over the Oxley issue, or indulge in some limited xrenophobia. 

\- TCB looks like an almost unwinnable situation since unlike the WP he has nothing to show, and there's nothing meaningful to complain about the Government. 

\- The election is not going to have rallies, due to Covid. This is going to massively favor the PAP. 

\- The big question is whether the WP can hold Aljunied. The good thing for them is that the court case is just about forgotten, however the bad news is that the WP has not done much high profile stuff for Covid, and so their case for staying in power is relatively weak. LTK did manage to hold Aljunied even with the LKY dying effect, though. I think the PAP will make a power play for Aljunied by sending in a senior minister (Khaw, probably) to unseat the WP. 

\- On the other hand the PAP is not going to strongly contest Hougang, since having token opposition actually has a better look than full PAP dominance.

Not able to post this now because reddit tells me it has been submitted before (never knew got this rule). This article shows us that we're making the exact same mistakes that the British did. To quote a few paragraphs:

""Part of the delay was not just garden-variety incompetence, but probable prejudice. Diarrhoeal diseases were often blamed on ‘Asiatic habits’. They were not crises to be tackled because they stemmed from the ‘insanitary and immoral lives of Asiatic races’. Since the ‘in-sanitation’ was a ‘hereditary Chinese instinct’, there was little and less the colonial government could do to improve things. Dirty people lead dirty lives in dirty places, and so it goes.

But as every academic of colonial Singapore would point out, such thinking was not only flawed but deeply self-serving.

It’s true that 80% of Cholera victims were Chinese, but filth is not genetic. It is easy to avoid diarrhoea when you live in a Tanglin bungalow with your own private water supply. Less so when you are sharing a latrine and a ‘diluted cesspool’ with 20 other people, with one water source for everything from bathing to cooking. By all accounts, severe overcrowding in urban areas was the principal reason why ‘bowel complaints’ were a leading cause of death.

However, by blaming the coolies for causing the diseased/filthy environment, rather than seeing them as the victims of a diseased environment which they were too poor to escape, the government could dodge the responsibility of carrying out oh-so-expensive housing and sanitation reforms. 

What’s the point of building sewers and houses for the irredeemably ‘undesirable’ coolies? Why indeed, when the money could be spent on more profitable ventures? After all, cheap labour is cheap labour, and the dead could be easily replaced. Southern China had no shortage of human capital.""

gc4mmi,1588417281,gc4mmi,32,,"**SUMMARY OF SPEAKERS' OPENING STATEMENTS (word for word transcript up to around 20min mark)**

**Kishore Mahbubani:**

* ""Strategic Pause"": US and China should put competition on hold, focus on cooperating against Covid-19, a common enemy. But the opposite has happened. Covid-19 has aggravated US-China geopolitical contest.
* US has made a fundamental geopolitical mistake in launching into competition with China without a comprehensive grand strategy.
* US unaware of the fundamental structural strengths China has developed e.g. CCP meritocracy
* US has developed structural problems. Income of the bottom few decreasing. America becoming a plutocracy.
* US inflexibility: rigidity of its grand strategy. US should stop fighting in the MidEast if it wants to focus on China

**Alicia Garcia-Herrero:**

* Decoupling: both sides will move to decouple their economies, reduce interdependence. But full decoupling impossible
* Covid-19 has created a shift in the US-China economic relationship, away from the superficiality of the trade war. Now more attention will be paid to diminishing the centrality of China within the global value chain. Not just by US; Japan and EU also noticing that overdependence on China (medical devices, automobile supply chain) exacerbates vulnerability.
* Deglobalization of people-to-people movement: Students shifting from US to elsewhere; workers in Europe etc. This will affect China (talent pool etc.)
* Technological competition: emergence of two separate, decoupled technological ecosystems (US and China)
* Financial disintegration: decoupling of US-listed Chinese companies, US investors in Chinese market. 

**Khong Yuen Foong:**

* ""Triple whammy"": US-China trade war + upcoming US Presidential elections + Covid-19 pandemic
* Larger structural dynamic of shifting balance of power from west to east. US identified China as a strategic competitor espousing inimical values. Must be confronted
* Blame Game: In US and Europe there will be immense pressures to assign blame and seek accountability over Covid-19. Will take on a very impassioned character due to death toll and economic impact. Huge anger directed at source of pandemic. Republicans and Trump will likely deflect blame to China for covering up the pandemic. Even Joe Biden will have trouble sidestepping this.

Job search has been tough not only in local markets but even more so for overseas markets as a foreigner. I mean, which employer would hire a subpar foreign grad over their own local grad?

My current plan right now is to try to secure a local job, work for 2 years and in the meantime, search for a job overseas while the economy recovers. If any of you can advise or share your knowledge with me regarding this, I would be so grateful!

Therefore, rather than for this to be buried in the daily thread, I thought why not put this in a separate thread so people can have an easier time when they wish to find references for such queries in future. 

I have been in my current job for only 6 months. 6 months in, and I quickly realized that the exacting, elitist and pressurizing nature of policy-making isn't for me. I think you can refer to my post history. It is very telling that something is wrong when you dread work even though its WFH. Coupled with tensions with my RO, something has got to give sooner or later. 

This is my second job. My first job wasn't perfect, but the work was indeed manageable. I was doing project management, contract management and engagement. It is very similar to what I would be doing in the job that I am interviewing for.  I was in my first job for about 1.5 years - 2 years. Left because I naively thought that my current offer would be a better one. Something that is more up my alley. I was also encouraged by my profs and my ex-bosses to go for it because (not blowing my own trumpet), my writing skills demonstrate potential so yeah. Try lor. Big mistake.

After sending out 110 job applications, I finally have an invitation for a job interview. It is a video interview to be held this week. 

Now, interviewers will definitely pick on my 6 month stint. I obviously cannot justify my reasons for leaving on the basis that it is a contract job, because even though it IS a contract position, it is a 2 year contract position. So I have to find another explanation. 

The job that I am interviewing for is roughly similar to my first job. Thus, I am thinking of whether to craft my reply (when asked) that I am leaving because while I had gained some skills from my second job, I realized that my passion lies in xxxx, yyyy and zzzz. I applied for this role because the job requirements (for my prospective position) are aligned with what I am passionate in, and are also similar to my first job. Thus, I feel that I would be able to better contribute. 

Therefore, the questions that I would like to ask are:
(1) Does my pitch/answer above sound convincing? If not, any inputs on how to better craft it would be greatly appreciated. 
(2) To those who had arranged for/sat through a video interview, how different was it from the typical face-to-face interview? Do you find that it is more difficult? 
(3) I am still considered a newbie in the workforce (if you define newbie as those with less than 5 years of working experience) so most interviewers will not penalize a 6 month job stint in the resume right? :/

How the WP won Sengkang, in marketing-speak:

1. Strong core messaging
The WP has consistently stuck to its refrain of ""we don't want to form the government, we just want to offer the checks and balances that are good for Singapore"". They refresh their slogan each election (""ownself check ownself"", ""co-driver to slap driver"", ""no blank cheque""), but the main message is constant, realistic, non-threatening and easy to understand. 

In contrast, much of the PAP's message is built on implicit threats (""we need a strong mandate to continue fighting Covid-19"", ""don't be taken in by false promises"", ""do you want to lose good ministers and Singapore's stable political standing and your jobs and home values and have our women become maids in other countries???""). It works as a scare tactic for a while, but the negativity can get tiring.

2. Audience segmentation
Audiences are not homogenous - what appeals to the older Teochew-speaking Hougang crowd may not resonate with English-educated young families in Sengkang. The WP clearly knows this, evidenced by the candidates they picked for each ward. Does the PAP also know this? Their Sengkang slate was all-male - younger on paper, to be sure, but offering no new perspectives for their target audience. If the PAP's idea of diversity is restricted to just throwing in one minority candidate in each GRC, they need to adjust their one-size-fits-all approach.

3. Staying updated with social trends
Much of the furore over Raeesah Khan's social media posts was dismissed by the PAP and its supporters as being ""imported Western values"" about ""race wokeness"" (my term, not theirs). But that runs the risk of dismissing the shared lived experiences of minority races in every single country around the world, including Singapore. And once you tap into repressed minority sentiment, it's not just limited to race. It extends to every feeling anyone has ever had of being discriminated against for an attribute out of their control (gender, age, body size, personality traits, etc). Young voters understood Raeesah's impulsiveness as much as her anger. They reacted with sympathy to her remorse, and with disappointment to the PAP's escalation of their attempted takedown.

4. Service recovery
Which brings us to the next point - when a mistake is made, perceived or otherwise, your audience wants an apology. Every customer service tome says this. By owning Raeesah's failings, apologising for them and standing with her, Pritam Singh set up a strong contrast against the PAP's treatment of the Ivan Lim incident. The fact that all these events were unscripted served to highlight the importance of shared core values. It's a cliche, but values are key to guide crisis decisions and reactions in a way that stays consistent with your overall brand.

5. Content marketing
There's a reason why the WP's candidate intro video went viral. ""Slick"" is as much a compliment as sour grapes. The video achieved that elusive quality of authenticity - the holy grail of marketing. Younger voters lapped it up. 

The PAP's comms efforts relied too much on their old playbook - character assassination, selective reading of literature, oddly poorly-worded press releases (one of which even drew a rebuke from Aware for casually referencing domestic violence, which is extremely out of touch). Time to change PR team?

6. Timing
The funny thing about this whole GE was how unprepared the PAP seemed, even though they were literally the only people who knew when the election would be held. No doubt they were distracted by the pandemic (then why hold it now?) and their own agenda of the 4G transition (also, why now?). By insisting on dictating the terms of the election timing, but then not delivering a well-prepared performance, the PAP disappointed on two counts.

One thing I would love to know is whether the WP deliberately steered the narrative towards East Coast while plotting all the while to grab Sengkang. Would that be giving it too much credit?",,How WP won Sengkang - An analysis from a netizen from marketing perspective,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hp6olz/how_wp_won_sengkang_an_analysis_from_a_netizen/

inooww,1599408787,inooww,33,,"So, I've been following this sub-reddit for some time, and every time Tharman's name gets mentioned, it is almost inevitable that people here will say that he should be SG's next PM, followed by people quoting (mockingly I suppose) HSK's infamous statement about older generation Singaporeans not being ready for a non-Chinese PM. 

But looking at the record of all of SG's PMs.. Yeah, I know 3 only lah but can only work with what's in front of me right? So.. looking at all 3 PMs in SG history - LKY, GCT and LHL - I noticed something about all of them. They are all intelligent (Yes, Tharman is intelligent), all capable (Tharman also very capable), tall (Tharman can physically look down on a lot of people) and they all have hair (Ok, here is the problem). 

Assuming that anyone who is a Singapore Cabinet Minister should at the minimum be intelligent and capable to a certain acceptable degree, then the height and hirsute factors come into play. There's no denying that LKY, GCT and LHL were/are very tall and have/had a full head of hair. Maybe for younger folks, LKY might not seem as tall and as graced with a full head of hair but check out the pictures of him in 1959, he towered over most of the Cabinet and had lots of hair. 

And being tall and having hair is important from an optics point of view. It's no secret that Singapore is a small country and as such some (many) neighbouring nations might think that it's possible to ""bully"" Singapore (my own included, sadly). Having a tall PM helps create an impression of dominance and strength, while having hair is also regarded as a sign of good health. When your tall and fully-haired PMs go out to the wider world, they are telling people through their physique that Singapore is a commanding and powerful nation. Or to put it in another way, they are telling others, ""You don't cibai with Singapore."" 

The height and hair factors could also be used to explain certain incidences in SG political history. Like why didn't LKY step down in the early 80s? Of course the official reason would be that he still had a lot of things to do. But looking deeper into it, was that the only reason? Incidentally, the 2 DPMs at that time were Dr Goh Keng Swee and S. Rajaratnam - 2 outstanding 1st gen leaders. Either would have made an excellent PM for Singapore... BUT! Dr Goh was balding and short and Rajaratnam was tall but balding. 

And when LKY finally stepped down in 1990, there were apparently 4 candidates to replace him. Goh Chok Tong, Ong Teng Cheong, Tony Tan and Dhanabalan.  All of them had hair and Tony Tan was reportedly LKY's choice, but in the end, the winner was the tallest of them all - GCT. And it made sense especially given that this was during the height of Mahathir being a dick to Singapore with all the not so subtle hints about cutting off the water and all that. SG needed a tall PM to give that aforementioned impression of power to Malaysia. 

And when GCT stepped down... Yeah, you know - LHL - tall, has hair.. ok become Prime Minister. 

The thing now is that the person who is supposedly the future PM of Singapore - Heng Swee Keat - does not fit the tall requirement. He has hair but is not tall enough. And maybe... just maybe, that is why LHL decided to stay on instead of committing to stepping down when he reaches 70. Yes, I know he said COVID but he could still play a key role in the government even if he isn't PM like what LKY and GCT did before. 

So, given that being tall and having hair are seemingly so vital to being SG's PM, and seeing that neither Tharman or HSK fit both roles (I don't know how tall CCS is btw, maybe someone can help), then maybe - just maybe - LHL will stay on past 70 or someone like Teo Chee Hean (he's tall and has hair) will step in as PM until they find a tall and hairy enough 4th gen leader.",,A Tall and Hairy Order or the Role of Height and Hair in Prime Ministerial Candidates.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/inooww/a_tall_and_hairy_order_or_the_role_of_height_and/

Let's start off on the positive note. 

The government's response to this coronavirus has been astounding. Never before have we been so direct, upfront and timely about potentially negative information. One that screams to me is how the delay in PSI reading release is correlated with the PSI. Its a great move and I hope the government will continue in this direction for all/any data request of a non-sensitive/public interest nature. 

Now.... it hurts me to say this.... 

We can't really fault foreigners for associating Singapore with China can we? 

True, this is partly their ignorance. However, the fact that Singapore faces the highest number of infected people, it points to how intertwined our economy is with the Chinese. And the reluctance for early travel bans also highlights how reliant we are on China.

Of course that's also my personal opinion but I'm here to just discuss how we can at least be more detail-oriented in outlook.


Recently there's been a massive spike in cases, but if we look deeper, the majority of the hundreds of new cases are really just the  dorm workers. This skews the data tremendously if we're only concerned about local transmissions outside the existing clusters (which going by numbers tally... are well, basically made up mostly of the dorms anyway).

**Say for eg.**

**400 new cases, out of which 399 cases are quarantined already**

vs

**400 new cases, out of which only 100 cases are quarantined.**

The number is the same, but how we should treat the number should NOT be the same.

It's like how people panicked when we used to get a record 70+ cases...even though most were imported. True, the imported cases can still spread into locally-transmitted cases but at  present, we dont know the likelihood of that.

There's also the factor of testing. How many people are actually being tested matters (just look at Iran and their fake numbers). If we didn't test all the dorm workers, the daily numbers we see would probably be much, much lower... and regardless, these workers being quarantined should raise no difference in whether their infections are added to the daily count or not I believe. Because the spread should already be contained to begin with...

Lastly, there are those who have already been quarantined and just tested after that...in which case, them adding to the infection count shouldn't matter as much either.

The ones we should be concerned about are the community transmissions...which are honestly, still significantly small in numbers. If we take away those from existing clusters, the number is even smaller (If im not wrong, only in a few or several dozens per day).

Again, I'm not saying we're being over-paranoid, but it's important to look at the composition of a big number than just take it as face-value. In that case, we can gauge the severity of the spread more accurately. If we ever see a day of 1000 new cases or something, before you go bonkers...look deeper at the numbers.

----------------

*EDIT: I guess downvotes are downvotes...*

*Seems like readers are getting the wrong message here. I'm not advocating to lessening our lockdown measures or anything. All I'm pointing out is the possibility for daily cases to drop drastically in the future. NOT mainly because of CB measures...but drop naturally...because most cases that we see at the moment are all only from pre-existing clusters and dormitories that are already quarantined and far far away from the general public. Once the dorm infections are over, the total no. of cases will likely drop.
So basically...don't go bananas when you see today's 300 new cases*",,A case of hasty generalisation fallacy: Why we should stop looking and being misled by the big numbers,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g0mbw9/a_case_of_hasty_generalisation_fallacy_why_we/
g5tofw,1587525525,g5tofw,34,,"I thought for a while and hesitated about posting this but after thinking through about this again and again, I've decided to give my potentially unpopular 2 cents.

Like the title says, I do know that it's absolutely necessary for this Circuit Breaker. I do know that  Covid-19 is a super tough SOB to fight. I do know that we have no choice because of many other reasons including people repeatedly flaunting the CB rules which partially caused this to extend in the 1st place.

I'm aware of the BBT ""last minute yolo party"" queue last night. While like many of the Singaporeans where I'm tempted to immediately scoff and jump in to criticize them, I thought for a while and decided to take a moment, and think through in regards to their situation, thoughts and feelings at that moment. 

Why do people seem to forgo all logic and common sense for something as trivial as a dumb cup of sugar, tea and boba? Why is it that we can still manage to stay home as much as we can but upon hearing about the non-essential F&amp;B ban, we lose all of our bearings and do ridiculous actions?

A lot of our lives have been disrupted out of the blue, with some of us handling it while others are breaking down entirely. You would see people doing funny stuff like using exercising as an excuse to go out, taking buses and intentionally going to far places, people using buying food as an excuse to go out etc. Does it sound stupid? Yes. But is it sad? Yes. Our lives have just been forcefully disrupted out of the sudden after all.

Also it's the 1st time that us as a nation, we had to observe such protocols in the longest time ever as a modern nation. Is this a #firstworldproblem ? Absolutely yes. 
But is it hard? Yes as well.

I'm pretty sure that many of us definitely have 1-2 snacks/comfort food of our liking/choice lying around at home such as loaves of bread, cakes, chips, crisps, soft drinks etc or whichever other sort of foods that you like during this period of CB. Now imagine having none of these for 1 month, and having to coop up at home + some of us facing personal issues or the aftermath of getting retrenched due to Covid-19. Would you be able to truly be alright, if this has been dealt to you on top of all the other stuff that has been handed to you?

In my humble opinion, food itself holds an important role even if we should be living to eat and not eating to live. Countless times in history have shown that food can make or break a nation/army. Food has been shown to be a mercy, comfort and deliverance for this harsh existence of our lives. Food has been made as our joy and blessing that we can afford to enjoy even in the toughest moments.

Thus, having thought all of these points made me feel sad and wanting to empathise with people instead of wanting to laugh/scoff/mock/scold them. It made me feel helpless about this pandemic as our hands are tied, yet we cannot do anything about it other than abiding by these extreme measures to combat this pandemic. It is all the more in such tough times that we as a nation should work together to support our brothers and sisters to overcome this together (yes, even the less bright ones). This saying is already overused and lame af but ""together we stand, divided we fall"" still holds true.

hkhyai,1593778219,hkhyai,34,,"Hello friends, I usually lurk but I've recently been thinking about some frustrating things and thought I'd share in the hopes that I'd be able to gather some advice.

So my dad (54 years old) has been self-employed since 2003. He ran a restaurant for a few years but it folded in the early 2000s. He then did a whole host of other freelance jobs, most recently settling for being a canteen vendor for the last few years. He only has an O levels cert and no other skills upgrading under his belt.

Lately, the canteen hasn't been doing well, especially in recent months because of covid. Even before covid, business was getting worse too because i think school enrollment fell and students also are more inclined to order in food/buy from the coffee shop nearby. I think the pay can be lived on, but I can honestly see my dad getting more tired and dejected, especially since he has to wake up early at 4/5am and go to school to prepare food. My mum goes along to help him and I can tell it really drains her because she has insomnia and usually wakes up at 2am and can't sleep afterwards. She's also a private tutor and while she's earning enough to sustain our family, I can tell she's very stressed about the family finances. My dad does most of the housework at home, though.

My biggest concern is how since both of my parents have been self-employed for very long, they have very very little money in their CPF, which means they have to work until retirement, if they can even retire. My brother has been working for years but he doesn't give my parents pocket money and they refuse to ask him because they feel such things should be given without having to ask, or it loses its meaning. I'm still in uni so I can't support them yet.

So I really want to persuade my dad to quit the canteen job and take up something else that has a little bit more stability and CPF contribution because I don't really think that being a canteen vendor is viable in the long term, especially since I can see him getting increasingly dejected and frustrated over the sales. Every day he comes home and complains about the school management not being fair to canteen vendors and how he hates the way they're being treated.

My question is: does anyone know of any schemes or pathways my dad can take to upgrade himself and get a better job that will pay him CPF? I know for sure there's SkillsFuture, but I'm also not exactly sure what courses to take. My dad is quite poor with technology, he can use the basic functions of the phone and search the internet and watch youtube, but beyond that he doesn't really know much. I also get the feeling that he doesn't want to be an employee and prefers his freedom, which I'm trying to respect but I'm also trying to find alternatives for him. His age is also a problem in that it might be difficult to upgrade and learn, and so are finances, because we're kind of tight at the moment.

If anyone has any stories or experiences that are similar I would really love to hear them. Of course, if my dad wants to stay in his current job I will not force him to change, but I'm hoping to gather some alternative paths that he can take and maybe convince him on the pros and cons. Please note that I'm in no way looking down on canteen vendors! They're very important and I know my dad enjoys interacting with students. But it's just that in recent years the prospects aren't looking very good and so I need to try and think of alternatives.

Thank you in advance!",,Where can my dad go from here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hkhyai/where_can_my_dad_go_from_here/

hri5o8,1594792646,hri5o8,34,,"**Maslow's Five Hierarchy of Needs (Singapore Version) \[By Dunkjoe\]**

&amp;#x200B;

The five needs are as follows, from the higher needs to the most basic needs in this order:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Self-actualisation (Self-fulfilment \[the fulfilment of one's hopes and ambitions\])

\- Esteem (Self-worth)

\- Love and belonging (Social)

\- Safety needs (Sense of security)

\- Physiological needs (Survival)

&amp;#x200B;

So, in short, I'll call it the 5 S of society.

&amp;#x200B;

In the order from the basic needs to higher needs in Singapore's context:

&amp;#x200B;

'1) Survival - I'm sure most people are familiar with the terms Kiasu and Kiasi, which are quite famous among the older generation, meaning ""Scared to lose"" and ""Scared to die"". Both actually imply similar things, which is the fear of not having enough resources to live. Or more specifically, money. It actually is quite symbolic of how Singapore was after it gained independence. There was great fear about not having enough resources to feed the family and survive in Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as Singapore grew affluent, this feeling is gone from a lot of people. Even then, there are still groups of people really affected by this, like the ""live from hand to mouth"" type and those living under the poverty line. They need to be helped in order to live properly and be able to contribute to Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Sense of security - This is tied to the feeling that one is in control, and that things will stay as status quo or better over the foreseeable future. For society, one word can encapsulate this sense of security for most people: Jobs. Without salary or some other income, it is really difficult to feel secure in Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

And with modern society, a new issue is born: the question of sufficient resources, be it housing, money, safe environment and so on. The double whammy of the current pandemic and global recession rocks the very fabrics of society over this. There is a need for the society and individuals to find ways to stabilise their sense of security, for if not, mental health issues might become prevalent.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Social - There is this growing sentiment that young people feel lonely even as social media becomes more prevalent. I mean last time, people communicate with other people not so far away using letters! But now, a simple Whatsapp can even transmit videos! This feeling comes as people become more engrossed with their smartphones and apps, especially in Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a need to establish more avenues for people to meet similar-minded people within proximity, best is face-to-face, but during this pandemic, through digital means.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Self-worth - As the Singapore society becomes more competitive and job security is becoming a sizable concern, many people's self-worth might be affected. This is especially for people who lose their jobs in their middle ages (mid-life crisis), but can include the young generation who might take internet comments more seriously than they are warranted, given internet anonymity and internet trolls.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a need to set up popular self-help channels and ways to boost self-worth without much time, effort or money. More research needs to be in this area as to reduce the number of people possibly having depression or some other mental health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I was quite shocked to find out recently there's this psychological trend called ""imposter syndrome"", and from what I have read here and there, it seems that there are a lot of people affected by this, often the people who are accomplished. People under this syndrome believe that they are undeserving of their achievements, aren’t as competent or intelligent as others might think—and that soon enough, people will discover the truth about them. There should be studies in Singapore and maybe public programmes to rectify this given Singapore's fast-paced and stressful environment.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/basics/imposter-syndrome](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/basics/imposter-syndrome)

&amp;#x200B;

5) Self-fulfilment - This is actually crucial for a developed country because most people should have sufficient levels of the previous 4 needs to have self-fulfilment needs. And it's this need that will lead a country to continue progressing and truly prosper. This is especially prevalent in successful entrepreneurs, various successful research topics by universities and other research agencies like A\*Star, among other feats that Singapore has achieved.

&amp;#x200B;

It is crucial for Singapore to boost the quality of this level, especially during these troubled times, so that people work on their maximising their potential, and to fulfil their hopes and dreams. This will propel Singapore to new heights once this crisis is over.

hw8hyn,1595475250,hw8hyn,34,,"Basically she was fine until a few years back (2015) when  her behaviour changed right after my uncle moved into his new house just down the street. 
 
She used to be very kind, loving and takes care of my cousins or my sis and I whenever our parents were busy with something dealing with all the house chores and errands.

Im too tired to list all the shit we have experienced with her. Basically now, she shouts and talks shit all night with many vulgarities (and has been doing this since 2017) at my uncle's house. I feel bad for my cousins cus they need to study and they can't cus she's shouting and can't even have a good night of sleep, not once without having to wake up. My cousin bro has the worst share of shit as he sleeps in the hall giving his room away for my grandma and grandpa. And while everyone tries to sleep by locking their doors, she will walk through the hall ruining his sleep by shouting and just talking nonsense.

This has been going own for 3 years and right after phase 1 hit she went onto a whole new fucking level. To threathen my uncle's fam beat up my grandpa (he's fucking 80 and body has weakened badly after repeated years of working as coolie and the mines, he started working at age 6) shout for 10 fucking hours straight and this legitimately sucks. 
She talks nonsense and all the things she says are just bullshit. We don't know how she does this and I think it's schizophrenia. (I'm not really sure tho cus we can't have as psych ever come to the house).  My uncle who has to take care of his children + parents (8 ppl in the house gave up and broke down recently). I was surprised he could hold on so strong to manage everything including his business which was affected by covid.
Without much choice, my mum (for the 684838th time ) went to plead them to come to our house and stay there,but this time shouted for hours and hours and dragged both of them along.

It's been 2 days and I'm already hating it. It's my mid term break in JC and I can't study ffs. She shouts and shouts whilst scolding my mum and our family, wanting to go back to my uncle's house. Obv my uncle had enough he even said that he doesn't love his parents anymore. My grandpa can't handle the situation but is always in her aid, which my mum hates cus that only adds to her behaviourial issues  relative to her mental health issues.

Throughout the night I cant sleep and just as I'm writing this now she is screaming at the top of her lungs at my mum. Somehow shes able to tahan whatever shit is being thrown at her. I'm really exhausted by what my grandma is doing and I need just a place where I can't be affected by her shit. I also worry for my parents' mental health - it's on a decline and over the past few years my mum justs vents all that desperation and sadness at me. I would be able to tell that Look on her face when I get home and she'd start going off at me for all the small things I do. It's not like I'm complaining about what's happening but whatever my grandma's doing had only brought sorrow and extreme desperation to our families. It's sort of like a ripple effect, it's painful to say the least.

End of my rant. Sorry I was just writing whatever that comes to my head cus I'm mentally exhausted. I've posted a few rants here and this and that all combined has really made me insane. I look tired at school, came to class looking like shit and my morale and happiness is on a downward spiral. It really sucks and I guess I do need help too. Probably professional help but I'm not well of or anything so I just push myself day-by-day asking why this shit has happened to me and not to someone else. In my case it's not only grandma making me mad, I have so many personal issues which I do not know how to cope with. It's hard.

Thanks for reading. It would be nice to hear some encouragement, it really sucks. I have made previous posts on this subreddit where I ranted about my problems with my family as well as how I'm doing in CB.

My partner and I just collected the keys to our new resale flat last week and we are looking to speak with a few IDs and contractors for quotations and ideas. As we plan, we met with more and more questions so hopefully you dont mind that theres yet another post on resale flats.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Budget wise, what is a good amount for furniture? (This excludes any kind of renovation and would include things like sofa, TV, bed, etc)

2) Is it wise to contact several contractors, depending on what they are offering? Obviously if we engage an ID, they will have their own contractors and everything will be handled swee swee but how about independent contractors?

3) how do you actually source for independent contractors for HDB flats? (\^\^"") We see a lot of IDs advertising online but not so for contractors.

4) We are looking to have pretty extensive renovations done, which will obviously generate a lot of noise. Is there something we can do for the neighbours (ie a small pack of goodies that include ear plugs) as we understand the situation now whereby most people are WFH?

TLDR: My mental health is suffering. Physical symptoms show. I experience dread and nausea just thinking about work. Working from home is bad enough but when I actually have to report back to office (where its just my boss and I in office)... holy shit the fear is real. I know I wont stay long in my current position (definitely before end of 2020)  but everyday feels like a torture. My boss sorta knows my intention to leave too. 

But it is covid-19 pandemic we live in. Everyone is trying to save jobs.... people I talk to tell me not to quit. Because it is practical. 

At this stage, I have a verbal offer from a Ministry but as you know, they take a hell of a long time (this Ministry took 3 months to call me for interview). Some people tell me verbal offers dont count. I also have a few interviews that I am awaiting the results for... 
To some people, the above accounts for naught. But to me, they are symbols of hope. 

For myself, my savings are sufficient to tide me through 6-8 months. But what strikes me is the uncertainty and the stigma that comes with unemployment.

I can’t get my tattoo before I enlist because 1. Covid affects all the tattoo shops 2. Big artists usually have clients before hand, so I wouldn’t be able to even get tattooed by end June.

ipwt9t,1599713588,ipwt9t,35,,"By this point in this subreddit, the sentiment of ""don't have children unless you are rich"", ""I didn't ask to be born"" and ""[Sorry, your kids are not your retirement plan](https://thewokesalaryman.com/sorry-your-kids-are-not-your-retirement-plan/)"" are pretty common. The idea is to actually plan for your retirement with money, savings, and retirement plans instead of relying on having children. Governments worldwide does want to push for its citizens to have children, and to increase fertility rate, mostly to no avails. Well, according to people like ([Dr Lacy Hunt](https://youtu.be/MnFCacYvdy8)), the root cause is excessive indebtedness. People don't feel hopeful about their future and have to keep running on the hamster wheels don't have children.

However, I feel like collectively, we committed an intellectual error and mistook money for resources, and create for ourselves an illusion that our retirement money future worth can be predicted using today's worth. The ability for today retirees to be able to actually retire and use their money to buy goods and services from the working is not dependent at all on the amount of money the retirees have today, but rather the [available resources and productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGQiQcNBggw) of the working. What retirement planning, savings, CPF, etc ... actually do is to prevent the working from consume everything they make and then transfer that savings' purchasing power to the non-workings (retirees, children, the disabled, the in-firmed) so that the latter can purchase goods and services from the working.

What would happen if the working people today consume everything they make? Well, what they would actually do is to incentivise more people to work in sectors that the young working prefer: restaurants, bars, hip entertainment venues, sex, etc ... instead of the sectors that the retirees need: aged care, health care, house cleaning, etc ... Thus the price for those services that the elderly need will go up. By limiting consumptions by the working via taxes, forced savings, retirement planning, what it actually does is to release the manpower and productivity from the young people's consumption and allow those to go into caring for retirees and the likes.

So what would happen if for example, today's working people decide to have only half as many children and instead save more money for retirements? Well, that thinking will work, only if a small number of people do it. If everyone does it, what will actually happen is when today's working people retire, the same or even more retirees' retirement funds and money will have to chase goods and services produced by only half as many working people. Assuming each sector's share of labour and productivity remains the same, prices will go up twice and purchasing power drops. The intellectual mistake of saying [Sorry, your kids are not your retirement plan](https://thewokesalaryman.com/sorry-your-kids-are-not-your-retirement-plan/) is to think that your money today will worth the same amount 40 years from now (even after adding interests to stave of inflation). My kids might not be my retirement plan but collectively, *our* kids are *our* retirement plan.

We can also think about the dynamics of the same amount of future retirees' money chasing half as many goods and services as it will incentivise future workers to pile into sectors that the retirees need, then perhaps the retirees' purchasing power will not drop. However, that does mean that society as a whole have fewer human resources available to pile into things like: high technology production, research and development, childcare, education for the young, etc ...

One assumption that many neoclassical economists will push is that perhaps in 40 years, our productivity will go up so much that each of the future worker will be able to produce twice as much. That's probably correct. However, some sectors' productivity improvements are harder than others. Case in point: aged care. I don't think the number of elderly people an aged care nurse today, 50 years ago or from now can spoon feed in a day has risen dramatically. Indeed, in the ""care"" sector (childcare, etc ...) the trends for quality control has been for one staff to take care of fewer and fewer people. Ministry of Education regulations from 30 years ago would have use a higher students:teacher ratio than today. The only way to increase ""productivity"", aka the number of people a staff can care for is to use rather inhumane methods, like ""[Lack of staff behind chemical sedation of patients in aged care facilities](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-15/aged-care-royal-commission-chemical-sedation/11116362)"". Hypothetically, they can just mass sedate old people and feed them through feed tubes. That will really drive up aged care productivity.

The only other way to make up for the shortfall in human resources is immigration from still high birth rate countries. Thus all the hoo-haas with CECA and what not. Politicians really have no choice, but they also don't understand, or they do, but don't want to explain why society, as a whole, need children this way. There is another alternative to reduce the inflation shock of too much retirees' money chasing too few goods: [reduce retirement payouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ti8RQPh7IE), increasing retirement age, create Byzantine rules to reduce amount of retirement funds you can withdraw.

Well, that's why having children is important. The State can very easily control how much money you will receive in the future. It's not like retirees will go into the street throwing Molotovs'; young people will though. Relatively, you retain greater control of your children than the State over your children or your money (well, if they really have greater control over your children than you then the country you are living really sucks and you are screwed anyway).

There's one more way to deal with too many elderly people and we are seeing it right now: just let a pandemic that kills primarily old people rip through.",,Demography is destiny or How I have learned to stop worrying and have children,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ipwt9t/demography_is_destiny_or_how_i_have_learned_to/

jitux4,1603769544,jitux4,35,,"There has been lots of controversy surrounding TT since the rollout started in September. This conversation came into the forefront with cinemas being the first implementing TT, and how it needs to be at least 70% adoption before we can commence Phase 3.

Here's my personal account with SafeEntry and contact tracing. I visited Tampines a few weeks to get my late lunch because...it's lunch. Nothing out of the ordinary. A few days later, I was informed a COVID case was in the vicinity...even when I visited the place a few hours after the COVID case left (you get these details on the app). I reached at 3pm while the infected case left at 2pm. So some questions and answers:

1. How was I informed? Through Singpass, and this was captured via SafeEntry. It also informed me why I was identified (in the vicinity of a confirmed case, virus could be in the area; I was dining which mean my mask was off which means high risk of infection)

2. Why was I a high-risk case? Because we know that the virus could still be lurking on the surfaces I touched in the place / the air I breathe coz aircon. Even after sanitising my hands upon entry, the droplets by the infected could still be circulating inside the restaurant a few hours after the infected person has left.

3. What did I need to do? Monitor my health for 14 days. Check for fever, loss of taste/smell, dry cough. Wash hands, disinfect regularly, wear a mask.

I asked myself, why was this done? Because our G wants to eliminate the virus and minimise the chance of spread. Even if there was a small chance (1% - 5% chance of catching it), they want to reduce it to zero. Can they cast a smaller net? Yes and that's with TT. Safeentry results in a lot larger variance and multiplying this a few times means there could be another lockdown because the uncertainty of confirmed cases is a lot higher...we still have infections in the dorms these day (1 or 2) but we know, like dominoes, superspreader events can happen.

Can superspreader events happen in SG? Hell yeah. Weddings are taking place, conferences are going on. Social gatherings and all that happen...and we all take off our masks when we are in someone else's home. Rituals (a ton of them) happen with alot of singing and no mask wearing. These are high risk events, and if we open the economy, more will happen and with an infection, we need to contact trace more precisely, affecting less people.

Now, this will bring me to the next point about TT. I think the conversation needs to be so:

1. Phase 3 needs to happen, we have to go out, open our borders, while managing infection. So I support TT.

What I don't support is that TT is used indefinitely without control (recall the blank cheque argument?) So the questions to ask are:

1. If there are mistakes during contract tracing for TT, how will you account to Singaporeans? Considering this is a very very complex project delivered in a short time. Do you have explanations to manage the risk of this happening?

2. If I have an infection, can I reliably use TT to contact trace? How will SafeEntry records be used in this case? I suspect we can only find this out after the incident.

3. Finally, do we have a plan to sunset TT the moment this pandemic is over? What are the concrete conditions to remove it? You said 70% needs TT as a condition for Phase 3. Then have you thought about what conditions should be met before we stop TT? Because...letting TT run indefinitely is the exact definition of a blank cheque for the G.

These are the questions I'd ask my MP / Parliamaent, and start my convo around TT. and these are my 2 cents, from a personal experience. Spoiler alert...I didn't get COVID.

You may have even donated to them, which is fantastic.

Me being stupid old me, I hadn't realized I didn't have my bank account registered with the government until they kindly hit my phone up to let me know. Thanks, big G. Anyway, given my extra time waiting, I wondered who exactly I should my $600 to??

Singapore, to be fair, has loads of charities for numerous causes, from protecting vulnerable women and sexual assault survivors to migrant workers to elderly healthcare and so on. Nearly every cause under the sun is covered by an IPC (Institution of a Public Charter, basically the fancy acronym for *""charity""*). You could get lost figuring out which one to donate.

To me, the biggest issue was making sure **the money I donated was put into good use.** I've covered that quite a bit [in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/) as one of my major concerns about donating money for a good cause. And now, in a time where we realize helping our fellow residents of the nation, citizen or not, is starting to become a pressing issue, I thought I could help a little.

This is to make sure whoever your donating to is *trustworthy* and makes sure your money goes to the right place. As far I can see, most of the charities here appear to be, but just for comparing how money is used, I think it'd be good to check on it.

*****

### What I'm Doing ###

In case you didn't know, Singapore has an [online portal for charities](https://www.charities.gov.sg/Pages/Home.aspx) where you can look up each charity, their expenses, donations and so on. Make sure you have Singpass first, as some IPCs require Singpass to see their financial information.

This site does present two problems, though. First, the site is **very clunky**. You go to the second page of a search, the site crashes. It can take horrifically long to load at times. And even then, quite a chunk of financial information is woefully off, categorised in all the wrong places and vastly different from their actual income statements/balance sheets.

Secondly, it doesn't tell you how *good* the charity is. One can look at a charity, see it has 15 million in donations, and go *""dayum that's a nice charity""*. But it doesn't exactly tell you that only spending 3% of that 15 mil on charitable activities is bad, which it very much is.

To help, I've decided to **rank charities in Singapore** based on how they **use their expenses efficiently**. To determine how efficiently charities are using funds, I'm using [CharityWatch's ranking process](https://www.charitywatch.org/our-charity-rating-process). CharityWatch is a watchdog for charities in the United States to ensure that most of their expenses are going towards actual, charitable causes rather than something else (*like owning shopping malls or starting music careers, for example*), and also ensuring they are efficient in their fundraising efforts. 

As such, I will give charities an overall rating from **A+ to F** rating based on the measures above, so that you don't donate to a charity that wastes its dollar a whole lot. An **A+** means they spend over 90% of their expenses to charitable causes *and* expend less than $5 on fundraising for every $100 used for charitable programmes. There are many variations either way, which I'll try to explain in the rankings below.

All these charities listed are either [in the major solidarity payment donation page](https://give.asia/campaign/donate-your-solidarity-payment-to-break-cycles-of-inequality#/), part of [Preetipls's Fundraiser](https://give.asia/campaign/preetipls-x-utopia-for-migrant-workers-ngos-433#/) or those under [Giving.sg's SGUnited page](https://www.giving.sg/sgunited). Mercifully, a majority of them lie in the A range, with a few quirks here and there. Do take note I left some charities out, primarily concerning hospitals and NUS, because just filtering which payments are 'charitable' are difficult due to their nature. Just don't forget about them can already :--)

The only thing I feel CharityWatch is missing from their ratings are how much *income is left unspent*, which could really affect whether your donation is being kept in an IPC's pockets. I didn't fully keep track, as I can understand why some charities keep more than they expend, but I will highlight particularly egregious examples, in addition to areas where the Charity Portal messed up in their financial evaluation.

Lastly, just because a Charity scores low, *doesn't mean its truly evil*. Most IPCs have **vague definitions** of charitable expense. Some just loop every single expense into one, some leave out factors other charities include (*like salaries etc.*) and some just list every expense without definition. I can tell you, after taking an accounting module in uni, I am *none the wiser*. 

These charities, no matter how great/poorly they rank, all seek some good in the community, so if they score poorly here, **DO NOT TAKE MY WORD AS GOSPEL**. Just double check for those that don't score as well, and keep your cause you care most about to your heart when donating.

*****
### Ranking the Charities ###
*(All based on their latest financial info, if available)*

**A+:**  Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), SPD, Children's Wishing Well, Beyond Social Services, Home Nursing Services, REACH, O'Joy Care Services

Most of these causes have used over 90% of their expenses on charitable programmes and haven't wasted a lot on fundraising, indicating efficiency in their use of funds. TWC2's finances are also reflected incorrectly in the Charity Portal as they double counted on expenses in their financial sheet, so they've done a lot better than originally looks.

**A:** HealthServe, AWARE, CARE, Metta Welfare Services, Trybe, Dover Park Hospice, Alzheimer's Foundation, Club Rainbow, Yong-En Care Centre, New Life Stories, Singapore Red Cross.

Both of the charities in Preetipls' fundraiser rate at A or above, indicating your dollar is going to good use if you donated to her :--). I'd also, personally, advocate for donating to AWARE, they deserve it for the assistance they lend to women-at-risk and sexual/domestic abuse survivors. I got stuck a bit at covering *Trybe*, mainly because they didn't record fundraising expense, but elsewhere they look alright. 

However, even though they are ranked at A, there's no guarantee that *New Life Stories* are that great, as they only expended less than half of their income in the previous report on charitable causes. They *are* a childcare centre, so maybe they were just saving for a new centre, who knows. I'm no expert.

**A- or B+:** HOME (A-), SG Children's Society (A-), Boys' Town (A-), *Community Foundation of Singapore* (A-), Singapore Breast Cancer Foundation (B+), Free Food For All (B+), Care for the Elderly (A-)

Although HOME *only* scores an A-, mainly due to a relatively low percentage of expenses towards charitable programmes, I would still highly suggest donating to them, given the conditions migrant workers have had to go through and their current, ongoing situation. On a personal note, I'm donating my money to them, TWC2, AWARE, HealthServe, Beyond and Red Cross.

The reason why the *Community Foundation of Singapore* is in italics is because, out of 39 million in total income, only **9 million** was spent on chartiable programmes and causes. I can give New Life a pass, but this I just *have* to draw attention to. I doubt they will be like this in this current time, though. Benefit of the doubt. Just ensure when donating to them, your money goes to the right place/people. 

Free Food for All and Boys' Town also had anomalies. Free Food For All didn't have their finances reported in the charity portal, so I had to check their own financial statements. Even then, a lack of statement on fundraising activities could mean the B+ may not be fully reflective of their use of money. 

Boys' Town was quite the reverse, as though their finances are listed in the portal, the *actual* financial statement is nowhere to be found. Still, I'd suggest donating to Boys' Town as well for their work for at-risk children.

**B or B-**: Filos Community Services (B-), Singapore Hospice Council (B), Food Bank (B), Hagar Singapore (B-)

These ones are generally less efficient with their dollar, though there's no real egregious cases like those I pointed out earlier. Only trouble was that Food Bank's Charity Portal page was all over the place from what I can recall, where their expenses are all over the shop as recorded in the portal. Other than that, they still use money somewhat efficiently, so no real massive problems here.

**C or D:** Blossom Seeds (D), Food from the Heart (C)

I've heard of Food from the Heart and the supposed good they've done a lot, so they surprised me with their low ranking, especially since they supposedly spent only *36%* of all expenses on charitable causes. Bit of a shame but oh well.

Additionally, I think Blossom Seeds also gets a bad rap here. If you look at their actual financial statement, their expenses to charitable causes may appear to be greater than that listed on the portal. However, I was unsure about this, as it mainly concerns tricky to classify payments (i.e. salaries? Also, vehicle upkeep isn't classified despite this being an elderly transport service). I came up with a **B-** for them with an alternative figure, which is still low but *wayyyy* better than the D as ranked here.

*****
### So what now? ###

Honestly, all the efforts I've seen in Singapore so far have been so damn heartening. Even if it is reactionary in nature to social issues that has been persistent for decades and exacerbated by this epidemic, the support for these vulnerable groups has been tremendous from a significant portion of society (or portion of my friends, either one).

I have to say again, though, *DO NOT TAKE THESE RANKINGS AS GOSPEL*. There could be all sorts of kinks in accounting stuff like this. I'm not majoring in it, I only took one university module in it. I tried my best to make sense out of a clunky portal, a rating system from a different country that misses out certain aspects of charities, and whatever financial info I know/I could find. It's good, but **not perfect**.

Honestly, I thought I'd find some IPCs listed that could abuse this situation for profit, but honestly, I don't see too many negatives. Some could be more efficient with spending, some could use more of their income, but on the whole, most seem pretty trustworthy to me. Which is better than what I can say about other groups that claim to be IPCs (*here's looking at you, mall near Buona Vista*).

The very last thing I can say is, if you *don't* need the $600 in this time, **PLEASE DONATE**. Donate to social issues you care about. Donate to vulnerable societies in Singapore. And donate to groups that you can *trust*. There can be many groups in Singapore willing to take advantage of this situation for a profit. 

I hope this ranking, while not the most comprehensive, can at least account for some of this, and make sure your donations are going to good use.

**TL;DR:** Most charities listed above are good to donate to. That's nice :--).

Much have already been said about the foreign worker cases and a lot of it are very fair statements - the government truly dropped the ball on this matter. 

However, to hear complaints about ""Phase one being a continuation of CB"" is just rich. Many of these people calling for a more lenient phase one are the by and large, the same group of people attacking the government for not mandating mask-wearing from February onwards. You simply cannot demand the government to ""play it safe"" and then, in another breath, be upset that the government is choosing to gradually open Singapore.

On why the circuit breaker is known as the ""circuit breaker"" rather than a ""lockdown"", I am very sure that the government already stated that the main crux is that they are still not giving up on contact tracing. Entering DORSCON red implies that the pandemic has already gotten out of control and that they are no longer containing the situation. This was one of the very first few points addressed during the first press conference when the circuit breaker was announced. To state that the government is opaque and does not communicate their decisions is at best, ignorant, at worst, malicious. 

As this disease is new and constantly evolving, you can't expect the government to maintain one strategy towards combating it. With the introduction of each new measure, the government not only holds a press conference. The measures are then broadcasted on every Singaporean TV channel, in the newspapers and even on various social media platforms or WA and Telegram channels. If are still having trouble keeping yourself in the loop, you are most likely, not even putting the basic effort to keep yourself informed. I swear, some people here would not be satisfied until LHL himself knocks on their door to inform them of any changes the government is undertaking.

Don't even get me started on the RQ incident where some really just bring up the topic to stroke their anti-FT boner. Relax. The government is still investigating the issue. If the government really choose to let them off, by all means go after the government for it. It is crazy to still see people engage in such conspiratorial thoughts when it has been getting harder for foreigners to find employment in Singapore since the 2011 election.

SINGAPORE — Infectious diseases physician Paul Tambyah from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has been named president-elect of the International Society of Infectious Diseases (ISID), becoming the first Singaporean to hold the position.

&amp;#x200B;

His term as president will begin in 2022. For now, Prof Tambyah, 55, will support the current president, Professor Alison Holmes of Imperial College London, in running the organisation, NUS said in a statement on Wednesday (June 17). 

&amp;#x200B;

ISID is a United States-based non-profit organisation with a focus on helping developing countries with limited resources that disproportionately bear the brunt of pandemics.

&amp;#x200B;

Started in 1986, the society, which has a network of more than 90,000 people worldwide, aims to support health professionals, non-governmental organisations and governments in finding solutions to infectious diseases. 

&amp;#x200B;

In an emailed response to TODAY on Wednesday, Prof Tambyah, who is also a senior infectious diseases consultant at the National University Hospital, said he was honoured to have been elected to the post “despite the challenging environment”.

&amp;#x200B;

His first encounter with the society was more than two decades ago, in 1998, when he presented his research as a postgraduate infectious diseases trainee at the International Congress of Infectious Diseases in Boston, US, organised by ISID. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He was later part of an organising committee for the congress when it was held in Singapore in 2002. 

&amp;#x200B;

Prof Tambyah said that Prof Jonathan Cohen, a former ISID president, had asked him to run for the post.  

&amp;#x200B;

“I agreed as I felt it was time to have a president from Asia, and that I could contribute to the society’s mission in improving infectious disease care in low- and middle-income countries,” he said.

&amp;#x200B;

“Also, this would present opportunities for clinicians and scientists in Singapore to get involved in the region and the world of infectious disease.”

&amp;#x200B;

But the medical veteran acknowledged that the appointment could not have come at a more challenging time when the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the postponement of major scientific meetings, and strained international collaboration and funding. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, he believes “the strong staff, under the leadership of Prof Holmes, will weather the storm”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Asked about his plans for the society, Prof Tambyah said that he would like to build on the work of Prof Holmes, and strengthen an “emerging leaders” programme that mentors young scientists from around the world and connects them with academics in major centres. 

&amp;#x200B;

“I would also like to get the global health programmes in (Singapore’s) three medical schools and connect them with the professionals in the countries where ISID is active,” he said.

&amp;#x200B;

Singapore’s three medical schools are the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS, where he is a professor of medicine, the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University and the Duke-NUS Medical School.  

&amp;#x200B;

Prof Tambyah added that Singapore can play a “tremendous role” by sharing its knowledge and resources in containing and controlling infectious diseases. 

&amp;#x200B;

Prof Marc Mendelson, a former president of ISID, said that Prof Tambyah was well-known to all in the infectious diseases field. “(He) brings a wealth of experience from his time with multiple international societies and august bodies as well as formidable experience across the spectrum of infection, including outbreaks, tropical medicine and clinical applied research,” Prof Mendelson said. 

&amp;#x200B;

A doctor since 1988, Prof Tambyah is also president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. He also headed the Singapore Society of Infectious Diseases from 2011 to 2015.

hp9qam,1594473039,hp9qam,36,,"Earlier this week, I posted about [my dream for Singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hly3ex/my_dream_for_singapore_thoughts_about/). To be honest, I was worried WP would lose either Aljunied or Hougang, or worse, that it'd be a complete wipeout.

Yesterday, I was so elated I couldn't sleep :)

WP took Aljunied and Hougang with comfortable margins (hell, PAP Aljunied could receive 10,000 dummy votes and still lose), and won Seng Kang too. Dr CSJ and Dr Tambyah just narrowly lost, despite the state machinery working in full force against them (mainstream media, POFMA, etc.). HSK, slated to be the next-generation PAP leader, squeaked by with a tiny margin. TCB and his brand-new party lost by almost a single percentage point.

I was really disappointed about East and West Coasts, and also for Dr Tambyah (less for Dr CSJ because I didn't have very high expectations of his performance due to his political history, despite my utmost admiration for his spirit)... but I also woke up hopeful for the first time in a long while.

Truthfully, I had almost given up on Singapore's future. I couldn't imagine living and building a life and family in a country that is increasingly dominated by a single party that controls everything, and isn't afraid to use its outsize power to crush critics and acquire more power (POFMA, reserved elections). It's a vicious cycle fueled by a positive feedback loop, barring some black swan event like a revolution. 

For years, people like me have been told we are the vocal minority, and made to feel like we don't belong in our own country. That we are naive and idealistic to care about stupid issues like human rights, civil liberties, and due processes... because there are important bread-and-butter issues that is what the silent majority really cares about. Jobs and infrastructure and housing over LGBT rights. Stability over press freedom. Low crime rates over accountability. It's okay that our constitution is treated as toilet paper, because your sister can jog in the neighborhood at 10pm without getting raped. It's fine that Josephine Teo not apologize, because your mum isn't a maid in another country.

But yesterday (or this morning), I felt vindicated, because despite the worst pandemic in a century and the worst crisis since Singapore's independence, PAP's popular vote was barely higher than in 2011 when there was massive resentment. I'm not dumb and naive. I'm not alone. There are other people who agree with my ideals, and together, our voice is loud.

So I'm hopeful, because Pritam Singh is now officially the leader of the opposition. Because the PAP recognizes that their old playbook of character assassinations belongs in the blue recycling bins. Because gutter politics has been loudly and decisively rejected by the voters. Because democracy is working. And this will hopefully herald a new era in Singapore politics - one with transparency and accountability. :)",,"GE2020: I have a dream, and today we're one step closer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hp9qam/ge2020_i_have_a_dream_and_today_were_one_step/

I do so primarily to support our HBB but, also, because they provide, the kind of cookies that I would make myself at home, if I had the time. It’s not the standard commercial cookies that are on sale everywhere but cookies up to your own taste. So in this way, the HBB meets an important need of many families celebrating their Hari Raya.

HBB are predominantly run by women, usually with caregiving responsibilities and is an important source of income for them. Although they bake throughout the year, it is during Ramadan that they can earn the most to pay for their own Hari Raya expenses and keep some for other needs. During these very difficult times, the income that the HBB earn is even more critical as some have spouses who have lost their jobs or whose income has been slashed due to COVID-19.

Going out to work or even working from a central kitchen is not an easy option for them as they have children to take care of. Many also care for their elderly and sick parents because they rarely consider sending them to an old folks home as the right thing to do. Also, apart from the time factor, it’s too costly for them to operate outside the home because of high overheads. They don’t have that kind of capital.

I am glad that they will now automatically qualify for the Temporary Relief Fund upon registration with SMCCI. I hope that the Malay Chamber will do its part in reaching out to the HBB and assist them so that they can benefit from the higher demand during this period.

I truly love the diversity in the choice of food and the convenience that HBB provides to working women like us. I feel that it’s become an intrinsic part of our food culture. Some HBB subsequently gained enough confidence and managed to convert their cooking to successful catering and restaurant businesses.

I sure hope that many more will be able to make that leap but, in the meantime, they need all the support that they can get to continue with their HBB.

I’m actually not a stranger to this. For many years in the past I was working with DEWI, the women’s arm of SMCCI, to promote the interest of HBB. I had supported HBB because I knew that this source of income is really important in contributing to their family's financial resilience.

I look forward to your cookies. But please remember to comply with the circuit breaker rules which is meant to keep everyone safe from COVID-19.

&gt; Summary

&gt; Boys and girls, to conclude, I would like to summarize for you the key lessons that I would like you to remember:

&gt; (a) Data has context. It’s not simply a matter of how many infected cases a country reports. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it is obtained. The capacity limits for COVID testing means that we need to be wary about believing the data and it is not because anyone is intentionally under-reporting.

&gt; (b) Don’t just believe what people tell you. Just because people tell you that if the dorms were better everything would be ok, you don’t just believe them. You ask why should it be? Don’t just take at face value. Just because someone has a PhD, don’t just believe him. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles.

&gt; (c) Learn to use imagination and do thought experiments. Someone tells you, if you only  listened to me and did this, everything will be good. Well, you just happily imagine that they were right and ask yourself, then what? The problem with these big mouths who talk a lot is that they just shoot off their mouths. They have no accountability to actually do anything. They have no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.

&gt; (d) Have a sense of perspective. We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment. 

&gt; (e) School v Real Life. My complaint about school is that it often misleads our students into thinking that every problem has a model  answer. Not true in life. There are situations where you know that sh*t is going to hit the fan and yet all you can do is to feel sorry for yourself while it happens in slomo. COVID19 is one such moment for Singapore. In times like this, we suck it up and wait to clean up after the mess is over. 

&gt; On this note, all please be good. Stay home and stay safe! If you need to go out, observe safe distancing and wash your hands regularly.",,Ben Leong: Teaching Moments from Fighting COVID19,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gq3kdq/ben_leong_teaching_moments_from_fighting_covid19/

himbjf,1593519712,himbjf,37,,"Dear Fellow Singaporeans,

&amp;#x200B;

For the next 11 days, we will be pretty much divided people, divided by our beliefs and our support for different parties. There will be flaring up, there will be flaming, even quarrels among the family members on various sensitive topics. Be it related to how Covid-19 devastated us dearly, or how many politicians copy and paste the ""vote for us"" quote in the speech, be it from the whites, reds, blue, black, purple, yellow, rainbow, or Vantablack.

&amp;#x200B;

Our values lies from whether we can put a bowl of rice on our table, to whether BMW 5 series or Mercedes E-Class would look better in our garage. It doesn't help when Singaporeans gather their voice online calling out or praising past actions from candidates, or simply posting fake news because every second without touching a keyboard akins to solidary confinement. But when voices are heard, they are heard over the microphone with auto-volume adjustments, at the same time capturing that ever faint ping-ping sound when too much time is spent.  


Nevertheless, for the next 10 days, we will be seeing many opportunities to create memes from the videos and statements coming out from every candidates, putting the important thing behind our minds, and that is ""How are we going to move as a nation forward"".

  
So as of now, I hope we can be reminded a very important point, that, 11 days later, no matter who win, no matter who lose, no matter who laugh, cheer, cry, whine at the x%, I hope, I certainly hope, that we can reunited as one, One United people again. (of course, while keeping a safe distance of 1 m between us. Our land mass can accommodate that, I calculated (checkmate factually, noobs). 

&amp;#x200B;

Singaporean, let us be empowered, vote, cheer, and then reunited after 11th July to move our nation forward, vote for me, Merlion Mk 2! For our Sentosa, residents, we also have a planned for the Sentosa. We have a Sentosa Singapore, we have a together and Merlion plan. Merlion mk2 at Sentosa. So we can at Sentosa so we look forward to working closely together with our visitors to enable the Merlion Mk2. Let me serve you for the next x years sitting in the middle of sentosa, vomiting 24 / 7. Vote for Merlion! Thank you.

hnieiy,1594219853,hnieiy,37,,"In recent weeks, a few things have weighed heavily on my mind. The 2017 reserved presidency, POFMA, and the calling of elections in the midst of a pandemic.

On the reserved presidency, it scares me that the Constitution - sacrosanct rules for any country - is something that can seemingly be ridden roughshod over. Widely perceived as a move to preserve power, artificial rules and requirements were suddenly put in place for presidential election candidates. Only one individual was therefore eligible. 

On POFMA, it scares me that the truth is what a small group of people can legitimately dictate it to be. To me, we have facts, which largely determine truths, which in turn determine what the falsehoods are. Facts are mostly set in stone. Did Mr A say “X”? Yes, that’s a fact. By saying “X”, is it true that Mr A is implying “Y”, which can objectively and reasonably be inferred from him saying “X”? Maybe, and in some situations both Yes and No can be correct answers. Sometimes, room for interpretation is necessary for what constitutes a truth, and what constitutes a falsehood. In the past weeks we have seen POFMA triggered in relation to politics. It is now clear that what is true or false under POFMA is only subject to one side’s interpretation as it deems fit. 

On calling elections now, it scares me that the PAP can be so opportunistic and power hungry at the expense of the people. The PAP has tirelessly trumpeted the need for a strong mandate so that a PAP government can properly navigate this pandemic. PM Lee says “COVID-19 is the crisis of a generation. It is more complex and more dangerous than any previous crisis.” Yet, despite the term of Parliament ending only in April 2021, and instead of focusing fully on dealing with COVID-19, Parliament was dissolved last month on the advice of our reserved president.

k06pfi,1606230603,k06pfi,37,,"I was a volunteer at my local CC distributing the tokens so here are some tips/insights into the redemption process.

[ COLLECTION PROCESS ]
1.  If you have installed the TraceTogether app, please do consider collecting the following week for the benefit of the elderly who are not tech-savvy. With school holidays having already started, many families/parents are eating out and ""one shot"" collect token. This means longer queueing times. From 10am to 2pm, the queueing time for today (Day 1) was at least one hour.

2. Expect to spend around 5-10 minutes at the collection counter because in addition to scanning NRIC and token QR code, us volunteers are also answering queries and giving token care instructions.

3. You need to bring or at least show photo of physical NRIC, ideally both sides. We use an app to scan the barcode, but if that fails, we manually type in.

4. You also need to provide contact number that will be tied together with the token. This can be the person's personal phone no. or home number. Let the volunteer know if you don't have phone number. (I met a few elderly who don't.)

5. Here's how the volunteers will help you redeem: scan/input NRIC (5s) -&gt; scan token QR code (5s) -&gt; input your contact no. (5s) -&gt; write your name on the white part (10s) -&gt; give care instructions + Q&amp;A (1min+). Repeat all but the last step if you are redeeming multiple tokens.

6. The tokens has unique QR code at the back, but a non-unique alphanumeric code based on collection location. That's why we need to write name on token.

7. Some volunteers will write your name on the token, some let you do it yourself. The token is quite small and the white name space even smaller so we use fine tip perm marker (that may smudge if it doesn't dry fast enough).

8. Yes, you can collect on behalf of household.

9. We don't give TraceTogether token for kids under 6 because they are usually accompanied by an adult and thus do not need it. 6yo this year are going into primary school next year so they can redeem BUT it is totally optional.

10. We accept Birth Certificate, NRIC card, Work Pass, Dependant's Pass. We just need proof of your NRIC/FIN. If you can bring the physical copy, show photo on phone also can. It's just easier and faster for us to scan your docs if we have barcode.

11. In addition to the token, we will probably also give you a flyer with care instructions (see below) in English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. One flyer per token, one smaller care instructions magnet per household.

[ ADDITIONAL CARE INSTRUCTIONS ]
1. TraceTogether token is NOT waterproof or fire/heatproof. It is just water-RESISTANT so keep it away from water and fire.

2. There will be a green blinking light every 1 minute on the side with your name. This is normal.

3. If you see no light after 1 minute, or red light (blinking or otherwise), the battery could be faulty or dead. Call the hotline on the namespace of the token or instructions flyer to get instructions on how to get the battery replaced.

4. If you lost the token, also call the hotline at the corner of the name space or flyer. Not sure if you will get another one though.

[ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ]
1. Do I need to switch off/charge/change battery?
No, when you get it, it is already permanently switched on and activated for immediate use. If there is a red light or no light, call the hotline to get the battery replaced.

2. If battery spoiled, do I go back to CC?
Ideally call the hotline instead. At least for this week we are probably swamped helping to distribute tokens to those who don't already have them, rather than exchanging.

3. Can I just verbally say the NRIC number?
I never had anyone do this so ideally show at least a photo/photocopy of the NRIC/FIN. It's more out of awkwardness than anything.

4. Can I just give home number for everyone for the token redemption?
Up to you, we just need a contact number to link to the token.

5. What battery need ah?
Dunno lol.

Prior to the CB period, I have been a fairly bright yet lazy student, failing to hand up lots of assignments in Secondary school but yet doing the best in several subjects. I did fairly well for my O’s, obtaining a L1R4 score of 10 at the lowest.

However, jumping to this year where poly started in the midst of lockdown, I have found myself struggling with disciplining myself to pay attention to class. I ended up getting painfully borderline results during the first semester, failing my computing math module despite getting A1 for both A math and E math in the O levels, all due to the lack of homework submission.

fmwfh0,1584864343,fmwfh0,38,,"Hi r/Singapore, 

Here's my thoughts on the current situation. Considering the constant continuous rise in numbers of confirmed cases in Singapore and around the world, the situation in Singapore seems even more critical now as we recall even more Singaporeans even back home - the next 2 weeks will truly determine the fate of this outbreak.

As local clusters still begin to form, and the number of untraced cases over the past few days continue to rise, our resources grow scarce and it becomes much harder to deal with the situation, despite the social distancing measures that the government has employed. Some companies have begun to trial work-from-home initiatives, but I still feel that the numbers are still insufficient in dealing with this critical situation as there are still many companies out there who will not do anything until the government forces them to do so by adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach. Albeit, such measures will likely cause huge disruptions to our lives and our economy, but in the face of Singapore closing its borders to all short-term visitors, working from home as an alternative pales in comparison to the seriousness of this situation and companies should be socially responsible in adopting such policies. Many people have complained about how the social distancing measures enacted this week - in which they do not appear to be very feasible? Just look at the number of people on the packed trains during peak hour.

Similarly, in the case of schools. It seems ridiculous for the government to encourage all companies to adopt a work-from-home policy when they still insist upon not closing schools. I feel that especially nowadays, especially as most people have sufficient technology in accessing e-learning platforms (and those left out have facilitated access by schools), e-learning is the right way to go instead to minimise social contact in schools. Come on, look at the social distancing measures adopted in schools - on paper it looks feasible, but if you look at the reality, with over a thousand school-going children continuously interacting still despite staggered breaks etc., it seems like a hotbed for spreads. Wipe-down measures are recommended but left to the elderly cleaners (who have been said to be the most susceptible) and the most questionable decisions are to go to school and sit in the classrooms to do e-learning, in which there is bare minimisation of social contact.

Admittedly, MOE's concern of disrupting parents' work, especially for those working in the healthcare sector, is valid, but in this point of time, asking people to work from home but leaving children in schools may not be the most feasible idea. Why can't we just leverage upon our technological capabilities to keep everyone safe and still prevent our economy from coming to a standstill? Let us be more socially responsible and truly understand the situation overseas - where death tolls have been continuously mounting and understand how lucky we are for now with timely measures - but more severe ones must surely be taken.

fxmiwo,1586409847,fxmiwo,38,,"The soft lockdown ""Circuit Breaker"" has affected all our lives - most businesses are shut, families and loved ones may not be able to see each other, and simple activities we used to take for granted can no longer be carried out. A lot of my friends seem to think that this action was made out of necessity, and I was unsure if that was the case. More jobs will be lost as a result, and the economic contraction more severe. I think this question comes in 2 parts. First, is the CB necessary, given the state we were in a few days earlier. Second, could a different strategy been used to avoid the state we were in a few days earlier. So, in my lunchtime WFH, i decided to look at some case studies and numbers.

**Looking around us in Asia for examples**
A lot of people within this sub seems to compare us to Malaysia, or to the US/UK. But as well all know, these countries are vastly different - the presence of soft and hard infrastructure for one. For example, its difficult for the US to ramp up testing to be able to keep up with their testing needs given their large population. So let us look at the countries/regions that the world usually compares Singapore with - Hong Kong, Taiwan and sometimes South Korea (collectively, the 4 of us SG included are considered to be the Asian tigers)

**Hong Kong**
HK policies for now seem to be in a state similar to how we were pre-CB. From SCMP *""Hong Kong has since late March banned public gatherings of more than four people, while cinemas, fitness centres, bars, pubs and other leisure venues have been ordered to close for two weeks. Restaurants also have to keep tables 1.5 metres apart.""* Note that there are some discussions if a lockdown (i.e. closing of non-essential businesses) is necessary. To date, HK has 961 cases, 4 deaths out of a population of 7.4m.

**Taiwan**
Taiwan seems to be the greatest example of a successful coronavirus response. From Japantimes *""Yet nearly 100 days in, Taiwan has just 376 confirmed cases and five fatalities while restaurants, bars, schools, universities and offices remain open.** 376 cases, 5 deaths off a population of 24m. No lock down of any kind

**South Korea**
Any case study cited globally as a success story - despite an early spread, SK managed to curb local transmissions without locking down or closing essential businesses. While they have a total of 10.4k cases and 204 deaths off a population of 51m population, their recent daily case count has been hovering around 50 for the past 3-4days.

**So why and how was this managed?**
**Because Singaporeans don't listen? Not really**
This was the part which really got me scratching my head. 
Initially, I thought that it might have been something often cited by Reddit - that Singaporeans have been out and about too much, becoming complacent due to our early success. **The numbers say otherwise**. Google is now publishing a mobility report to help Governments better tackle the virus, and the most recent report as of 29 Mar shows that our mobility is in line with these other countries. In fact, our Retail and Recreation mobility has dropped by 28% - higher than the 19% and 9% fall of SK and Taiwan respectively. Only HK's fall is higher - 35%. There are a number of statistics here as well, I won't go into each of them, but generally it seems that comparatively, we have reduced our activity as much as if not more than other countries 

**Because the government didn't shut down public transport? Not really either**
There's a lot of criticisms about the government's action not to restrict public transport, with detractors saying that even transient contact may be dangerous. Again, the numbers show that this may not be the case. Mobility through transit stations in Singapore is i more than the 3 other countries. SG saw a fall of 40%, as compared to -45%, -24% and -17% in HK, SK and TW respectively. If transit is to blame, these countries should have seen a similar surge.

**Because schools are open? Maybe, though probably not**
There has been quite some debate about whether schools should stay open as well. There aren't any hard data points I could find about this, but Taiwan has managed to keep cases low while keeping schools open. That, plus the fact that few of our clusters are schools and the school clusters primarily involve adults, prove that this may not be the case. I.e. the schools are just as likely to be hit as any other workplace. But since I lack any hard data to prove this (maybe the kids are asymptomatic and spreading it around, some may say), I will refrain from comment.

**My hypothesis - lack of aggressive testing**
Well, this is purely my opinion, and one which I welcome criticisms / evidence that suggest otherwise. I came across a reddit post 1-2days earlier that said that Singapore doesn't test all flu like symptoms on the first day of having coughs, but only if it persists or the individual shows pneumonia-like symptoms. Furthermore, SK, TW and (as far as news reports seem to insinuate), HK, all allow for voluntary testing - i.e. anyone can get tested, but they will cover the cost of tests themselves for $20-$60 depending. I've since confirmed this with friends who have recently visited doctors for minor coughs, but please tell me I'm wrong if otherwise. If true, this may be reason why community spread got out of hand as quickly as it did. Both WHO and doctors who fought at the epicentre in Wuhan have spoken about the need for rigorous and extensive testing throughout the community to stem the spread.

**And hence my final point and conclusion**
I think the government has done well, in general, but has put in place a little too lax of a testing regime. Extensive contact tracing, effective to curb spreads where we know exactly where potential patients are coming from (e.g. China) worked wonders for us, but seems to work less well in a time where the virus is spreading rampantly within the community.

Do I think that the government should have held off on the CB? Yes - I think they should have instead put forth an aggressive testing regime like in SK and TW. Could I possibly be wrong? Yes. It's very possible or even likely that the government had access to more data than I to conclude that the situation was getting out of hand to the extent that nothing but a CB would work. Cases in SK, TW and HK (which is likely, as noted earlier) could surge, prolonging the damage. But I also think that we need to, as a populace, be conscious of the fact that there are always alternatives and potentially better solutions, and there needs to be discourse on what the best course of action is. Both during the pandemic, for alternative solutions, and after the pandemic, for accountability and future learning.

In deciding on the date for the GE 2020 polling day, the Prime Minister had clearly been guided by a widely claimed truth, that is, in times of crisis, people take a ‘flight to safety’ by giving overwhelming support to the incumbent leadership, rather than by casting their lot with an as yet untried and untested opposition. Hence the PM did not hesitate to set Polling Day right in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic. He assured all voters that the government would take every precaution to make sure that voting would be totally safe. He was clearly confident of a resounding mandate for the PAP’s return to power.

But when the election results came in, he and his colleagues had a shock. There had been a marked swing towards the Opposition. Although the PAP kept its majority and would continue to dominate in parliament, it was clear that the Opposition had made deep inroads into that majority.

Suddenly the ground that had felt secure under the PAP feet since 1968, was beginning to shake, with forebodings of a seismic eruption if the voting trend continued. In his post-election TV appearance, the Prime Minister looked sombre and worried, gamely admitting that he had been hoping for much better results.

What had caused Singaporean voters to actually buck a universally acknowledged trend in voting behaviour? Why hadn’t they given their full support to their leaders during a crisis serious enough to put world leaders on a wartime footing?

An honest answer would expose the complex, perturbing nature of the relationship between Singaporeans and the PAP leaders. It is a relationship that has always been marked by ambiguity and contradiction,by a curious mixture of two opposing states of mind and feeling, namely , respect and resentment. The respect is for an efficient leadership that has given Singaporeans a good life, with all the material comforts which people in other societies can only yearn for. The resentment is against a self-serving leadership that ultimately cares only about maintaining power, best achieved by creating a contented, compliant electorate. Part of this maintenance of power is intolerance of dissenting voices which are immediately slapped down. No sustained effort has ever been made by the leaders to bridge this gap between themselves and those they lead. It is noteworthy that the leaders have never been described in the epithets of emotive nurturing and human connection, such as ‘warm’,’affable’ ‘approachable’,’highly regarded’, ‘popular’, ‘likeable’, etc. Instead, the praise has always been limited to the detached language used for high intellectuality,proven efficiency and moral stringency.

So will post GE2020 Singapore with the PAP being still the predominant power,be just a continuation of the status quo? Has anything changed? Yes, something has changed, and in a radical way. It is the upsetting, for the first time, of a stance which Singaporeans had developed towards their leaders, whether consciously or unconsciously, over five long decades and which they have learnt to live comfortably with. It is that curious respect-resentment ambiguity, just described, which , though far from ideal, has the comforting feel of habit and familiarity. Now suddenly that ambiguity is being replaced by the fear of change. For the close numbers and margins in the GE2020 results point to the possibility, once unthinkable, of the PAP losing its majority and Singapore emerging as a two-party or multiple-party state, with all that implies of an overhaul of existing state structures, institutions, age-old traditions and expectations, indeed of the entire ethos itself. It would be change on an unprecedented scale. Moreover, it could happen in the foreseeable future, creating an unrecognisable Singapore. It is a most alarming prospect for Singaporeans who have long been habituated to a one-party government and the stability and predictability of its rule. Even when these Singaporeans express a desire for change, they could never imagine such a scenario. Their alarm highlights the special nature of their attitude towards the PAP. It can best be expressed by an array of pronouncements which appear contradictory - ‘We don’t like you but we want you to be around’, ‘We appreciate your efficiency but you’re unlikeable because of your arrogance and aloofness ’, ‘You are too elitist and can’t ever connect with the ground, but you’re okay as long as you make Singapore safe and the environment clean,’ etc. In short, there is a split between head and heart in the Singaporean as he evaluates PAP leadership. While the head acknowledges the good work of the PAP, the heart is repelled by the cold, ruthless efficiency that marks its demeanour. While the head wants the PAP to continue as the ruling party, the heart wants to see a little humbling take place now and then.

I believe that it is this ambivalence of Singaporean voters today, especially of the increasingly large bloc of young voters , that will stand in the way of a resounding win for the PAP in future elections, where it is not likely to improve much on the unimpressive performance of GE2020. Indeed, if no lesson is learnt from this election debacle, the party may very well lose its predominant position in the next GE in four or five years’ time, a period long enough for the Opposition to turn itself into a formidable force, and for the young voters to become even bolder in their push for major political reforms. They have become a force to reckon with, and can only grow in strength and influence in the coming years.

One problem of Singapore’s leaders is that they have always been guided by an entrenched conservatism, showing great cautiousness about any change that even remotely suggests the need of an overhaul, preferring the small, incremental changes of evolution to the tumultuous swings of revolution. But in a world of dizzying transformations, they may have no choice but to join hands with their younger counterparts who are ready to face challenges, take risks, even embrace dangers, rather than be left behind in an increasingly demanding world",,[Dr Catherine Lim] The Surprising GE2020 Election Results: What Could Have Happened?,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hsl0gz/dr_catherine_lim_the_surprising_ge2020_election/

&lt;background&gt;

On one side is empathy, naive and headstrong. I imagine that elderlies who sell tissue (and masks recently) do so because they rely on peddling to make ends meet. Playing cat-and-mouse with security guards in malls, risking COVID by stationing themselves where the foot traffic is. I imagine nobody who doesn't need to peddle will peddle.

And I know that so many elderlies are not able to retire; so many do not have safety nets in old age. I've seen it for myself. And so, despite myself, I buy in excess, and return some of the goods. 

On the other hand is reason, a bundle of scar-tissues, always an afterthought. Maybe they're doing this to earn a quick buck? Why can't they work somewhere? Why can't they retire? Where are their children? Am I just chipping in for their cigarette money? Why aren't they seeking official venues of help?

It's almost as if I'm paying a tax of cynicism for every measure of goodwill. The troll under the bridge that demands I see the world as the worst possible incarnation of itself. It forces me to see black where there should be nothing but white. So inexplicable they are, so divorced from reality, that I know it has to be wild imagination.

But the disturbing scenarios play out in my mind far too long. A bitter aftertaste that entrenches itself as the conclusion of every single act of kindness. Sometimes it seems I cannot cross the bridge of my conscience any other way. 

&lt;/background&gt;

So basically, how should I react when I come across elderly peddlers? I want to help them if they need help, but as a student who doesn't have much myself, I want to be sure that my money does go to a good cause, rather than (for example) enabling negative lifestyles. 

Also, do elderlies need to peddle when times are tough? Are there any official venues where they can seek financial support ad hoc? If yes, how can I support these official venues?

gxt41m,1591457719,gxt41m,39,,"I get that Singaporean are working together or are expressing unity and solidarity and all that wishy washy stuff. But I just feel that we are learning all the wrong lessons about this virus. This virus didn’t spread because people were divided. It spread mainly because of the migrant community in Singapore. I think back in March or April when cases were in the thousands, mainly due to abhorrent living conditions in migrant dormitories. 

This is not a lesson in unity. This is a lesson in the ills (literally) of unfettered capitalism. Why is it that in a supposedly first world country you can have your own residents living in sub-human conditions. More than 12-14 people in one small quarter, sharing unhygienic bathrooms and working tirelessly for less than the minimum wage in other countries that actually have minimum wages. That’s fucked up, and no one seems to care. That’s greed and capitalism at its finest. Opportunistic vulture capitalists seized on a cheap source of labour, exploited them and now no one is talking about it even when it is the source of the outbreak. 

Why is it that the new 6.3 billion stimulus bill  exists to bail out corporations and give peanuts to workers?We have like 70% of the benefits given to businesses and weak commitments and mandates for firms to pass on the cash payments to their workers. Even when they do, these payments often come with strings attached, like signing off on less paid leave days. Meanwhile the measly 30% are peanuts compared to the regular expenditure of a middle income household. I mean for fuck sake, even Trump, right wing president, had the decency to provide USD1000 during March, indiscriminately and we have SGD300 in transfer payments (much lower in USD by PPP considering cost of living differences). 

This is a lesson in the ills of capitalism.

Why don’t we have direct pay check supplements, instead of paying firms to be the middleman in the hopes that they pay their employees. Why don’t we have hazard pay for bus Drivers and the Cleaners who are on the front line? Why don’t we have free healthcare yet? And most importantly, why am I the only one who has bothered to point this out (if this gets removed I’ll know why)

The government seems to have this pro-business, pro-capitalist brain worm infestation that lead to they system we have today. “Capitalism is good, it attracts businesses from abroad”, they espouse. Yeah and it’s killing people. Those shareholders up to are making money but none of that is ever going to trickle down, if so what’s the point. PAP loves to create these Rube Goldberg machines to achieve the simplest objectives of equity in unorthodox, unnecessarily complicated, but barely working manners. Masks are good, and so are free Covid-19 tests, but why stop at just there without making healthcare free?? Paycheck protection is good, but why introduce scummy conglomerate firms as this annoying middlemen? 

Capitalism has clearly failed, but not a single propagandist seems to want to report on it, or learn from it (at least not here). I’m honestly starting to think that this whole “stronger together” is another way for the PAP to shift the responsibility to citizens and offers a distraction for news outlets to cover such stuff while ignoring systemic issues.

I live in the Robertson Quay area, and given that today is the first day of Phase 2, I’ve noted an exponential uptick in the amount of people in the area, especially at this time at night. All the restaurants are open and many people are meeting (in groups clearly more than 5). 

I was taking my dog downstairs to use the bathroom and I saw at least 50% of the people with absolutely no masks worn, standing/congregating around drinking, talking, laughing with NO masks.

I felt angry at British landlords evicting NHS workers, or people refusing to sell food to ambulance drivers, etc. Today I felt this sense of righteousness dissipated when faced with threat (real or perceived) of getting COVID.  

This morning, I took a cab where the cab driver told me he had to pick up a minimum no. of clients per day to cover rent. so I felt sorry for him and asked him about how business was - he shared about how he needs the income as he has a son who’s graduated for a year but still unable to find employment, and he’s trying to make money etc. 

At the same time, I noticed he spoke with a very hoarse throat and was coughing. He wasn’t wearing a mask - but that didn’t bother me right away because long driving shifts are uncomfortable. 

A few minutes later, he told me his daughter works in NUH, and that her ward handles 34 COVID patients. rationally, I understood that everyone has their livelihoods to attend to or keep. However, behind this polite conversation, I was panicking and worried about potentially picking the virus up (and passing it on to others, especially my parents). Was intending to wear my mask when I boarded the cab, and felt it was too impolite to put it on after he mentioned his daughter works in NUH, and that she lives with him. 

Nonetheless, I waited for the journey to come to an end and alighted. I rationalised to myself: healthcare workers tend to be the *safest* - because they take extra precautions to be sanitised etc so they will not pose more risks to their patients. And with that, I tried to take my mind off it. Not trying to be a hypochondriac, but right now, my throat and nose feels very warm and heaty - and I hope all the cooling remedies will save me. 

I feel like every decision is somewhat morally ambiguous - should I have taken public transport? should the cab driver have worn a mask?

hmo4jn,1594097931,hmo4jn,42,,"True story k no astroturfing. 

I live in a hdb (I am poor). Yesterday, someone knocked on my door at night. I thought must be salesman. Recently a lot of salesman and property agents. 

It was a lady in a red shirt. She greeted me and introduced herself as someone from psp. She asked if I would be voting in the election. I immediately thought ok not bad she did not assume I’m a maid. Probably because I unfortunately was standing there shirtless in my panties. Fuck that normally scares away the sales people. But I did not want to scare these people away with my panties. 

Anyway I went and put on some presentable clothing, my hatsune miku T-shirt (never wash for a week alr).  The lady patiently waited for me to get dressed. I decided probably no time for a shower. She asked me if I have heard of psp. With all my willpower I resisted the urge to shout I have been a loyal fan all my life starting from the very first sony PlayStation! Of course I have heard of psp. In fact my classmates in primary sch were all sega Saturn supporters fuck them. Only when I invited them to my house to play twisted metal and bushido blade then they realised ps is obviously better. But yeah I replied the psp lady of course, it’s dr tan Cheng bocks party. In fact I grew up in west coast grc under him and he personally handed me many scholarships and bursaries (i have humble background). She asked if I knew any candidates in the grc. I diligently recited the names of the four candidates which I knew by heart because I am an active and responsible r/Singapore subreddit user. Unfortunately I fucked up the Malay name and said abdul raman. Anyway yeah 3/4. The psp lady was pleased though I suppose this means I score top percentile already. We did not discuss any policy issues I suppose cos psp doesn’t actually have any policy besides vote for tcb and no blank Cheque. She asked if I would be voting psp. I said of course I would be voting! She happily left. (I never said voting what right?) 

Conclusion: not bad I was not accused of being a maid, lady seemed friendly for an unpaid volunteer. Respect people who do grassroots and take action instead of virtue signaling online like you fuckers on this subreddit. 


So today I met a pap volunteer. This time I was out buying lunch. So not in panties.

Compared to friendly psp. All our lives we have been told to obey and comply the white so subconsciously my buibui belly also shrank a bit seeing these elites. 

I had a conversation with a pap man maybe around my age (mystery).  He told me he was a volunteer not one of the candidates (I asked him are you a candidate). Heh of course I knew exactly who were the four candidates. Interestingly he could recite the full plan of what the pappies were going to do to improve both the infrastructure, culture and other tangible things for this slum town area we live in. I wonder if they force the volunteers to memorize this. I asked him why did he choose to volunteer for the pap instead of playing dota daily like me. He said something about wanting to help the people. Ok I guess. I asked him whether he is from civil service. He said no, he from private sector. I pressed him more, he is from a GLC. Overall, I concluded from this one anecdotal meeting that the pap volunteer seems to know more and presented more facts and plans. We parted amicably with him thinking I was gonna vote for pappy. 

Having met a sample size of one volunteer each, i conclude that I feel more confident discussing stuff with strangers when I’m wearing more than just panties.

I don’t know about you guys but it seems like so many people in my social group/ age range (20-25) have started becoming financial consultants or insurance agents. They seem to be harping a lot on this Critical illness (CI) definition change that’s supposed to be a really big deal or sth.

Can anyone enlighten me what’s so important about the change? I already have pre-existing health insurance regarding critical illness so is there really a point in buying more under this “new definition”? 

Additionally, a bunch of people are talking about savings plans as the way to go. As if it’s the be all end all of financial planning, is it really worth it tho? I have been propositioned to buy a bunch of savings plans from AIA, prudential etc. but I’m not sure if the policies are as good as the how insurance agents present them. 

The idea is to put in 200-400 a month and allow it to compound for up to 20 years. After that I can let it keep rolling until I’m a 100 (I think lol, probably be dead) or take it out whenever. 

In particular, however, I see the following flaws (some specific to me) in the policies:

1. Extremely long time to break even on your payments. Depending on your policy it can take up to 20 years before earning anything, and the amount earned is lesser if invested elsewhere. 

2. As an undergrad I have no steady income so a premium of 200-300 a month is really costly. (Adding on I can’t withdraw anything for the first 3 years) 

3. There is no real guarantee that the interest rate claimed (say 3.8%) would actually be the interest rate used to compound my savings. Especially in post Covid, I’m not sure if the interest rate would remain that high. 

4. There might be hidden expenses like management fees that snowball/compound as the years go on to become a sizable opportunity cost. 

5. I might be planning to do further studies immediately after my undergrad degree, so I won’t have a steady income in awhile, making the policy more of a burden at least for the next decade. 

Is there any real pros to engaging in an endowment plan? Or if not what are some better ways to invest my money if I have a sorta conservative investment profile? Or is this a good thing to start with only when I have a steady income?

I just want to know if this little situation of mine is common HR practice cause I've been speaking to a few colleagues of mine in the workplace and they have been telling me about how much they dislike the new HR in my company. I am not sure how to proceed or what to think about this situation.

2 weeks ago my grandmother passed away suddenly however she was in the Philippines when it happened. (Am half filipino. My dad is a Singaporean). Currently working in an SME company. I took compassionate leave last week to mourn and help my mother get through this tough time.

We can't travel back to the Philippines because of covid so we can only resort to staying home and attend the funeral through a livestream with some help of relatives over there.

Fast forward a week. Am now back work and today I was informed that my compassionate leave is invalid since the death happened in the Philippines. Now I need to reapply the leave using my annual leave instead. I realize this might be a unique situation but as I said earlier, I am not sure what to think about this.

In order to obtain something or achieve something, you must work for it. It is a fact. Money doesn't drop from the sky regardless if it is PAP or any other opposition running the government.

If you want that high paying job, you must really work hard for it and make yourself worthy for it. If you want that car, you need to work hard for it and earn the money to pay for it. If you want to stay in that condo, you need to work hard and save up to afford it. It's that simple. There is no alternative to that (unless you are that rare few that are born into super rich families). 

That statement might sound harsh. But sometimes we need to put in the effort in order to archive what we want (and also put aside our ego) . Personally, my dad started working with just an O level certificate. However, he worked hard and continued upgrading himself. Studying for a diploma while working and eventually a part-time degree. At 50+ years old, he is finally earning a comfortable wage. Due to his low income prior to further education, his further education was a mix of company + gov + self payments. His hard work paid off and we are grateful for being able to have an okay life in SG. If he didn't use the opportunities to further his education and experience with grants from the company and the government, we will definitely be living in relative poverty today. 

He is a role model for me and he allowed me to realise that in order to have something we want and need we have to sacrifice something along the way. Be it time, energy or effort. 

For the upcoming GE, jobs are definitely going to be a contentious topic due to the COVID-19 situation. It is tempting to demand more from the party on jobs or financial assistance or payouts or play the blame game. It may be hard to find jobs now but it is definitely the perfect opportunity to re-skill and upgrade yourself with the appropriate policies from the party. Good things will come if we put in effort and do the right thing.

&lt;Scaling up our Testing Capabilities&gt;

Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. That’s why we have been steadily building up our national testing capacity.

From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. To date, Singapore has tested about 2,100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the US has tested 1,600 per 100,000 and the UK 1,000 per 100,000. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases.

In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests. So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6,500 per 100,000), far higher than the testing rates seen in countries like South Korea (one in 90, or 1,100 per 100,000).

One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community.

We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.

As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers. This expanded testing regime is of critical importance in enabling us to safely resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.",,Singapore Rams Up Testing To More Than 8000 Tests Per Day.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g92sdn/singapore_rams_up_testing_to_more_than_8000_tests/

hed1fq,1592912324,hed1fq,44,,"This'll be a fairly short post, and I may miss out on a few points that could be brought up here, but this is why hosting the election right now is a dumb move.

-------------

**1 -- Unfairly Disadvantages Certain Groups of Voters**

I don't know if there'll be any change to the voting procedure to previous General Elections outside of the simple move of ""*follow safe social distancing, wear masks and stand metres away from each other y'all*"". In which case, this will be a disaster.

You see, in the [Voter FAQs](https://www.eld.gov.sg/faq_voters.html), there is *no mail-in voting* allowed. If you're hospitalised, cannot vote. If you're on a SHN, cannot vote. If you cannot make it, physically, to a voting centre, cannot vote.

This will compromise *several* voters. From those issued a Stay Home Notice, Quarantine Order or similar stuff, they obviously cannot teleport the ballot box to their room, so that's them done. Any elderly or people with pre-existing medical conditions are putting themselves at risk whenever they go out and vote. No matter how few cases there are, there's still cases. It's either risk a life-threatening disease for these people (heck, for others as well) or don't get a chance to make a change for you and everyone else.

**1b -- The Health Risk**

Already touched on it a bit on the last point, but now we all are summoned to gather in one place to vote. Obviously there'd be restrictions at the actual location, but what about transport? What about areas outside the boundaries of polling booths (like nearby malls or similar areas)? Everytime I go out to shop, I have a sense of fear and risk. Now that'll be put into everyone gathering in a single location to vote.

**2 -- Abandons Citizens in the Middle of a Crisis**

Parliament is dissolved. Ministers were often the ones we saw on TV that announced all the changes to current social distancing protocol. Some of these changes were by the week, some were by the day. As much as I don't like the PAP for being not so transparent, at least I can say they were **there**, making changes and finding out how to recover.

However, now, literally *DAYS* after Phase 2 is in place, seeing the biggest lift in restrictions for Covid-19, they choose to leave Parliament. What happens if a sudden spike emerges in cases? What if there's more incidents that arise in this state of entropy known as 2020?

In a pivotal time of crisis, where the ship could sink anytime, the ship has been abandoned just to confer on who should steer it.

(*Disclaimer: I know it's just one institution out of many being dissolved, but still, there's bound to be a knock-on effect after this.*)

**3 -- The Obvious Effect of Covid-19 On Voters**

Okay, now I'm just gonna put a disclaimer here and say anything and everything can affect how people can vote, and how ruling parties, in any scenario, can convince voters to keep voting for them. But in the middle of a global issue, with everyone looking at MPs more than ever, this is probably the biggest point.

I don't know any specific term (not a polsci major), but there's lots of signals being sent that certain national messages targeted towards recovering from Covid-19 are being used for political gain for certain parties (and as much PAP implications this hold, this also applies for several other parties as well). This epidemic is being politicized at a time where, honestly, it shouldn't be. If we're supposed to 'stick together' or whatever the current buzzwords are, the last thing we need to get through this is something that can divide everyone, from families to friends, co-workers to commuters.

**4 -- It's Not Needed**

We literally have until April 2021. We didn't need to drop everything in the middle of the year. We could've waited until Christmas. Or CNY. That's a *loooooong* way away. Why the panic? I know they had it planned for April or some shit before Covid, but why have it now **before the whole situation is dealt with?**

----------------
There may be some gaps missing in my argument. This was done *really* quickly in response to the announcement just now. I suggest checking out any other feed that will cover the elections (*say, CAPE or SG Climate Rally or just your parties' webpages*) to get more accurate information about the upcoming elections. I may have missed some info rushing this, so lemme know any other reasons why this election shouldn't be held now.

Quick little translation with my crappy chinese is that basically, onions (with the ends cut off or whatever) can absorb the flu virus and keep you healthy. People who did it never got the flu, doctors found the flu germs on the onions people placed in their rooms, etc.

f6883t,1582103160,f6883t,45,,"I find some of the comments in this forum mocking the “stupidity” of Singaporeans disturbing. I also find the mocking tone in CCS’s recent leaked audio disturbing too. 

Instead of just blaming the people for being “idiots” and “suckers”, perhaps CCS could engage in some reflection, get some feedback from the community, and think about why the panic-buying took place? Is it just all the fault of “idiots” and “suckers”? Or are there other parties involved who should be held responsible too? Including the government itself?

.

I think it is important to note that, before the panic-buying of rice and instant noodles (and yes, toilet paper), there is already the situation of masks and thermometers running out-of-stock in retail stores islandwide. This happened very early on in the virus outbreak, and is likely a significant contributor to the later run on rice, instant noodles, and yes, toilet paper. 

If masks and thermometers could run out for more than a week, isn’t it possible that people worry about rice and toilet paper running out when DORSCON was raised to Orange?

.

There is also the issue of trust. If people trust the government, trust that it is able to effectively regulate the supply of masks, thermometers, rice, toilet paper in the market, it’s unlikely that the panic-buying would take place. 
Yet panic-buying did take place. Should the government be concerned about this issue of trust? Because it’s a fact that the supply of masks and thermometers has dried up in almost all retail shops everywhere in Singapore.

Also, shouldn’t CCS, a member of the government, be concerned that there is a vulnerable and gullible group of Singaporeans being influenced into acting like “suckers”? Yet instead of talking about how to help this group of Singaporeans which has been taken advantaged of, CCS in the leaked audio blamed them for damaging the reputation of Singapore.

.

&gt; “Actually that night, Friday night, I was thinking maybe some retailers, are you involved or not? The retailer trying to clear the old Chinese New Year stock, Christmas stock. Send out all the video, then everybody go. Now when you go to Sheng Siong, NTUC, you buy all fresh stock because all the suckers have bought the old stock.

This is one part of the leaked audio clip which just doesn’t feel right to me. If we were to make a moral judgment here, who do we blame – *those manipulating/exploiting the suckers, or the suckers?*

Strangely, I didn’t hear CCS making any criticism of those manipulating/exploiting the suckers to the business leaders in the meeting. Especially since there are businesses profiting from these runs. What I did hear is the audience chuckling over the jokes CCS made of the “idiots” and “suckers” though.

.

If you find someone doing something “stupid” (especially when it will jeopardise the well-being of others), it is alright to step out and criticize that someone directly so that he/she will stop those actions. But to mock your own people behind closed doors, with a select group of business leaders, just doesn’t feel right to me. It feels divisive.

Worse still, you don’t target the issue of those manipulating and exploiting the suckers, which would be a topic relevant to business leaders – you blame the suckers. To be fair, I don’t know all that was spoken by CCS in the meeting, but I do wonder who the government blame for the panic-buying. Does the government blame itself too?

.

The mask situation early on in the outbreak was poorly managed, I feel. Which led to some sort of trust erosion.

First you keep hearing that there’s enough stock of masks in Singapore, but if you try to buy one, you can hardly get any in almost all the shops in Singapore. It’s confusing. Then you have MOH starting this strange campaign where posters are put up everywhere, with the big headline stating: “**Do not wear a mask if you are well.**” How fishy is that?

For a poster coming from the Ministry of Health (from 23 Jan onwards?), telling not how to stay healthy in the midst of this health crisis, but to not wear mask if you are well. Huh? What is going on? Why is the Ministry of Health telling me such things?

If it’s an issue of mask-shortage, why don’t the government address the issue directly and tell the people not to waste and hoard masks so that there can be enough for those people who are unwell to wear them? Instead the government went covert with their poster campaign, asking a ministry of health to actively try to discourage healthy people not to wear masks.

.

I’m not sure if members of the government know what it is like to travel at least twice a day on crowded public trains and buses with strangers standing right beside you coughing and sneezing without covering their mouth and nose. How are these at-the-moment healthy commuters supposed to feel with “**Do not wear a mask**”?

It doesn’t help that in the early phase of the outbreak, many people who were wearing masks in Singapore are PRCs (my personal observation). Not the low wage PRC workers, but the fairly well-dressed ones who were doing so. It also doesn’t help that there were rumours of masks been bought in great bulks by Chinese and sent back home to China.

I have nothing against China. It’s a terrible situation over there, and governments all over the whole world should pitch in to help. But if the rumours are true, why are masks being snapped up in bulk in the open market and sent overseas by the Chinese? Why isn’t the government regulating the supply of masks and be the one sending masks to help China? Why are Singaporeans instead finding it difficult to get masks for ourselves? And against such a backdrop, when we see strange MOH posters like “**Do not wear a mask if you are well**”, how are we supposed to feel?

I’m not sure if there is a disconnect somewhere, but I wonder if CCS knows what people are feeling and going through during this period.

.

So what is the true intention behind “**Do not wear a mask if you are well**”? What is the true intention behind all the propaganda over surgical masks not really helpful in protecting people from the virus? 

If the issue is about proper wearing of masks and effective protection against the virus, then state the issue as it is to the people. If the issue is about not having enough masks for every Singaporean to wear everyday, then state the issue as it is and impose measures to regulate the sale of masks. I’m actually certain that a large number of Singaporeans would be willing to have masks available for the medical personnel and the sick people who really need them.

.

As much as we want to work towards a unified Singapore, perhaps we should reflect if our conduct/speech is actually promoting divisiveness instead, especially when we start regarding certain groups of fellow Singaporeans with disdain. And rather than just blaming them for their apparent “stupidity”, perhaps we can make the effort to think deeper as to why they are doing the things they do and saying the things they say.

I’m not sure why there seems to be a hyping up of the issue of “shunning nurses”. But perhaps we can spend some time understanding why there are members of public who are fearful of being in close contact with nurses.

If we can empathise with the nurses’ worry over being exposed to the virus in their line of work, why can’t we understand that there are people who are anxious too that these nurses are exposed to the virus? It’s the same fear at work. If nurses who already know the hygiene protocol in their hospital well are still anxious, how much more so the general public who do not know just how nurses clean themselves after duty?

Just as we should reach out to the nurses to lend them our moral support, we should also empathise and reach out to the fearful to help them through this period of time. Yeah, if we are uncomfortable being near nurses and feel the urge to move away, it’s okay. Just learn to do it discreetly, and perhaps with a smile.  I’m sure the nurses can understand it. Because many nurses themselves are just as fearful of being exposed to the virus; they will be able to appreciate this same fear in others.

.

I think I’m rambling at this point, but I hope I’ve raised some points that perhaps some of you would find worthy of thinking deeper about.

&gt; TraceTogether (TraceTogether.gov.sg) is a mobile app that supports Singapore’s efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing. Through the exchange of short-distance Bluetooth signals between mobile phones with the installed app, each phone can detect other participating TraceTogether phones that are in close proximity.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s a handy list of nine geeky facts you need to know about TraceTogether.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #1 - The government is using the TraceTogether app to track or spy on every citizen’s whereabouts.**
&gt; 
&gt; No, the TraceTogether app does not collect any location data and there is no way for the government to locate your whereabouts with this app. The app uses Bluetooth technology to exchange connections with nearby devices that have the app. The app only has the ability to show connections between devices, and not their locations. Furthermore, the logs stay in your phone. Should MOH need the logs for contact tracing, they will seek your consent to share the logs with them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #2 - With the TraceTogether app running on my mobile phone that's Bluetooth enabled, anyone, including the government, can hack into my phone and extract all information in the phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; TraceTogether uses Bluetooth, a short-range peer-to-peer communications technology that is ubiquitous in mobile phones and devices today. It can only transmit signals within a range of about 10 meters. Using 
 TraceTogether is no different as connecting other devices or wearables to your phone via Bluetooth. It is impossible for anyone to get close enough to you, and use a computer to extract information from your phone without you noticing. TraceTogether uses several layers of security to keep your data private. Find out more at: https://go.gov.sg/tracetogether-privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #3 - If I download TraceTogether and give consent to all in-app functions, I am essentially allowing the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the government to collect and gain access to all my personal data, as well as the data in my phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; When you set up TraceTogether, you will only be asked for your mobile number. This is the only personal data that MOH will hold about you, and it is stored in a highly secured server together with a random anonymised User ID that is linked to your mobile number. The security level of this server is as high as those servers that store other official information.
&gt; 
&gt; All MOH will get is your phone number. Commercial apps for emails, web browsing and movie-watching collect more data about you than this app.
&gt; 
&gt; When the app is running on your phone, it will create a temporary ID, generated by encrypting the User ID with a private key that is held by MOH. The temporary ID is then exchanged with nearby phones, and renewed regularly, making it impossible for anyone to identify or link the temporary IDs to you. The temporary ID can only be decrypted by MOH, with MOH's privately-held key. Your phone will store the temporary IDs from nearby phones, together with information about the nearby phone's model, Bluetooth signal strength, and time. All this information is stored locally on your phone, and not sent to MOH, unless you are contact traced.
&gt;
&gt; These measures protect users from malicious actors who may seek to eavesdrop and track interactions over time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #4 - If MOH contact-traced to me and asks me to upload the data stored in the TraceTogether app, the Ministry can also extract any other data that they want from my phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; When a TraceTogether user is a confirmed COVID-19 case and agrees to upload the data log in the TraceTogether app to MOH, MOH will decrypt the temporary IDs in the user’s app using its privately-held key, and obtain a list of phone numbers from the uploaded data log. Each phone number will only have the information related to the Bluetooth signal strength and time information. That is all the information that MOH will get from the user’s app log. Based on the signal strength and time information, MOH will then determine which devices were in physical proximity with the confirmed case.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #5 - I do not wish to download this TraceTogether app which will increase the risk of a data breach on my phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; The TraceTogether app does not increase the risk of a data breach on your phone. Given the TraceTogether app’s security and privacy safeguards, the risk of a data leak from your phone as a result of TraceTogether is very low. By downloading the app, you can tap on technology to enhance contact tracing -- a key pillar of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. The choice is yours to make.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #6 - All information in the TraceTogether app is uploaded onto a server that faces a perpetual threat of being hacked into.**
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from your mobile number, at the point of registration, all data collected through the TraceTogether app is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. It is not uploaded to any central server. The data will never be accessed, unless you have been confirmed as a COVID-19 patient. The MOH contact tracing team will then ask you for explicit approval to access the data in your app, and it is transferred to private storage that is not exposed to the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #7 - Other TraceTogether users can see my phone number.**
&gt; 
&gt; Mobile numbers are not revealed to other TraceTogether users. Only temporary IDs, generated by encrypting the User ID with a private key that is held by MOH, are exchanged between phones. Your mobile number remains secret and is not exchanged with other mobile phones. As an added layer of protection, the temporary IDs refresh regularly. Even if you could decrypt the temporary IDs, you would still not be able to obtain the mobile numbers of people you have been in contact with.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #8 - Even after I uninstall the TraceTogether app, my mobile number and the randomised User ID will remain in the server forever.**
&gt; 
&gt; Once the app is uninstalled or TraceTogether’s functionality disabled, all connection data collected on your phone will be lost. You can also request for your mobile number and User ID to be removed from the server by sending an email to support@tracetogether.gov.sg. This immediately renders all data collected by other TraceTogether phones about their interactions with you meaningless, because that data can no longer be associated with you.
&gt; 
&gt; Once contact tracing activities cease, the TraceTogether will prompt users to deactivate its functionality.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #9 - Running the TraceTogether app in the background uses up a lot of data and phone battery.**
&gt;
&gt; The app uses about 1MB of data in a day, which is equivalent to the data used by watching 1 second of a high definition movie, and consumes only marginally more battery than phones that already have Bluetooth enabled.

&gt; 
&gt; If you are convinced now that the app can do more good than harm, download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.bluetrace&amp;hl=en) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/tracetogether/id1498276074) and help everyone at home to download too.

(OP edit: no idea why the iOS App Store link was to the US App Store, so I've changed it to the SG one.)

Foreign Employee Dormitories Act  
————————————————

Many of the issues related to some foreign dormitories which have come to the fore over the last week or so are unfortunately not new. Several NGOs had raised them over a number of years. The issue has also come up in Parliament before.

In 2015, I spoke in Parliament on the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill that covered dormitories which housed in excess of 1000 foreign workers. I asked the Government to (i) consider building and operating foreign worker dormitories to catalyst improvements in the sector; and (ii) make investors and shareholders, not just dormitory operators, equally culpable should the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories be deemed unsatisfactory.

 I remember MPs, including some PAP MPs going beyond the remit of the Bill to speak of foreign workers who reside in small factory-converted dorms/rooms accommodating less than 1000 workers. This was a live issue when the Bill was debated because in late 2014, a fire in a unit in Geylang that was about 1300 sq ft in size (slightly bigger than a first-generation five-room flat) - that was allegedly partitioned into 11 rooms occupied by between 88-100 individuals - caused the death of 4 workers. In another case, it was reported that two small apartments in Selegie Road had more than 50 workers who ""slept shoulder to shoulder, amid rotting food and soiled clothes"". 

 COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the predicament of some foreign workers. We have a window of opportunity to review some issues thoroughly. Fundamentally, it is not just a regulatory review of the living conditions of foreign workers that is urgent, but more importantly, a total mindset shift towards foreign workers that is in order for some of us. Even so, it is indeed encouraging to see ordinary Singaporeans sewing masks for them and donating towards their well-being. But this advocacy and support must sustain itself after COVID-19 is defeated. 

 The sector is massive. Well in excess of half a million foreign workers – living in different types of accommodation. For some Singaporean employers, there is very little to improve. The pictures in this post highlight one example of a Singapore company, whose owner I am proud to call a dear friend. The company has instituted processes to ensure their workers are looked after. But good outcomes don’t happen automatically. Employers and supervisors must take a personal interest to ensure the well-being of our foreign workers. 

They build our homes. They clean our estates. And they do a lot more we don’t know about or will not be able to bring ourselves to do nor endure.

All foreign workers who work in Singapore deserve dignity and respect. We shouldn’t have to say this anymore.

As a medical student I’ve done readings on research regarding covid and I can tell you this: people do not recover from covid without suffering permanent damage. There will be reduced lung capacity, and injury to the lungs. It’s like smokers: they look fine on the outside, but if you test their tidal capacity etc you will notice a lot of pathology and damage. You won’t recover and become healthy again. So let’s not pretend we can all get covid just because we are young and healthy. Yes, we won’t die. But no, it’s not good to get covid at all cuz it’s permanent damage.

So many people are demanding we end this circuit breaker, that we RESUME NORMALCY. But let me tell you this: there will NEVER be “normalcy” again. If covid becomes endemic, and we don’t have a vaccine, we will be in “heightened mode” for the rest of our lives. There may not be quarantine at home, but we will have to maintain social distancing and work from home where possible. Unless of course, you want to sacrifice yourself and get covid for the sake of proving a point.

Covid MUTATES. Like the seasonal flu. Meaning you can get it a second time even if you previously recovered from it the first time. Vaccines won’t be a foolproof method because we need to update vaccines to match the mutation rate (think of online games, you need to keep patching the game to keep up with updates).

inzzky,1599449144,inzzky,46,,"Usually, calling the Police solves the loud neighbour problem which is what we did last night but it did not solve anything for us. The unit above ours has been making loud noises which can be described as dragging and dropping things on the floor regardless day or night. Sometimes, we even hear screaming, shouting and loud music.. It's ridiculous. The key thing to note here is the offending neighbour also knows we are the ones who contacted the Police since we have been kindly telling them to stop. They always respond with ""Okay"" but sometimes end up making even more noise. 

The Police got back to me and informed us that the household has a child with Autism. But this does not take away the fact that they CHOSE to ignore the Police officers warning and advice while not making an immediate effort to solve the problem. I even gave them a simple solution... Our units have two floors and we sleep on our second floor which means they have been making noise on their first floor. So, all they needed to do was move whatever the hell they were doing that was pissing us off up to their second floor. But they did not, they even told me that the kid (who has autism) will just run down... Uhmmm, duhhh? That's because everyone is downstairs, chatting and not giving a shit about sleep? If everyone moved upstairs, turned off the lights downstairs and started enforcing this at night, I would not be posting this on Reddit lol.

I mean how hard is it to give it a rest? The noise happens almost 24 hours a day.... During night, we cannot sleep and during day, we cannot work or have a day's rest in peace. I have worked and interacted with people with Autism belonging to different ages and I understand it is not easy to raise or interact with someone with Autism BUT ALL the people I have met with autism, even children can understand and change their behaviour when learning from example and based on routine.

It's unbelievable people can be so selfish and blind even when they are in the wrong. Shameless and pathetic tbh...

Not so fast. What would happen if we postpone NS? Not just for the current NSFs, but for new intake as well. Will the new batch be forced to intake later, and how much later? It would be unrealistic for them to postpone their life another year waiting for intake to happen.

At the same time, if everyone intakes after the pandemic, say, September, there would be too many people entering at the same time. Can you imagine how supersized the ""opening ceremony"" would be, how many people will go through BMT at the same time?

And again, if the intake happens next year, the batch will be bunched up with the ones going in next year.

Could they cut this year's NS time to just one year? Immediately, there'll be crab bucket cries about unfairness, and y'all know how MINDEF is very strict about ensuring every boy gets served his dues.

For the pre-school teacher's detection, I'm sure not many people had this fresh in their mind, that they queued up without safety distancing during the checks, as seen on this MS article:  


 [https://mothership.sg/2020/05/preschool-teachers-covid-19-test-queue/](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/preschool-teachers-covid-19-test-queue/) 

&amp;#x200B;

We know that wearing mask **reduced** the percentage of spread, but social distance plays a part to **eliminate** the possibility of spreading. Even with masks on, at that kind of distancing practiced as shown in the article, even if I'm not a medical expert, I can probably tell that could be a potential issue resulted from that.  


Are we ready to open up our country to ride on the picking up of economy, and risk having a 2nd wave outbreak? Personally I don't think so because:  


1) Our economy is fragile: Certainly if there's a best time to open, that'd be to open ahead of many other countries. However, if we got ourselves in deep trouble due to 2nd wave, our economy will be even more impacted than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Our society is fragile: You can certainly see that the social distancing practice in this circuit breaker is having a significant effect. So why is it not 0 per day? Certainly, there are people (coined as Covidiot) exist that doesn't give a single care about this social distancing. The spreading is still there, there are still irresponsible people around.   


3) Our enforcement is weak, not only society as a whole (yes, we, the people + enforcement agencies  + staffs etc), but we are not ready to condemn these people enough to bring the number to zero. We do not have the effective education among society to tell people to ""cover mouth when coughing"". What makes us strong enough to deter such practices should we spot one?

4) Our healthcare are stretched. We are certainly not ready to handle a sudden surge in the community when we are getting our hands full on dorms.

hl6qo1,1593882414,hl6qo1,47,,"Hello, I thought it'd be nice to share with all of you guys on how the experience changed with COVID-19. You can ask me anything at all in the comments. Anything at all. I won't explicitly say my company as I'm worried about jeopardising my commanders' reputation just in case. I enlisted end-March in 2020 and passed out very recently. I was the batch who were sent home in regulation with the Circuit Breaker measures.  

The timeline of my BMT looks like this. 7 days in camp, 7 weeks at home. 18 days in camp, 2 days at home. 12 days in camp, 3 days at home. 5 days in camp, pass out, and 7 days at home. What a ridiculous ride that was, going to camp knowing that it's just confinement after confinement. Bookouts were a luxury we all, even the commanders, looked forward to.  

The policy of wearing masks came in after the circuit breaker. By rule, the only time we do not wear masks is when we are in our bunk, eating, or during conducts. Conducts being live firing, physical training, route marches, etc. Every single other activity requires mask-wearing. That includes marching, walking around your corridor and _walking_ from point A to point B no matter what you're wearing (even if it's FBO; a field pack, bulky belt and helmet).  

The worst has to be _hentak kaki_ with the mask, where you march on the spot - raising your legs to 90 degrees with every step at a high tempo while shouting a song. I couldn't breathe. Marching with the FBO and the mask is also really difficult. _Totally_ not intense activities so a mask must be worn.  

The only thing I'm grateful the mask policy bestowed upon me is the excuse of camo application. I have only applied camo once (not during field camp), just for practice. We weren't allowed to wear the mask with camo on, so it seems that they prioritise the mask. I'm grateful for that.  

The 1-metre social distancing is also always drilled into our heads from day 1, even before circuit breaker. ""1 metre between everyone, 5 metres between functional groups."" It's not always easy to keep our guards up and keep our distancing, humans just naturally move close during interaction and I have to go against my instincts. Helping your friends during when they struggle to arrange their items within the time limit (force preparation) - while maintaining the social distance - is nearly impossible. Even simple activities like retrieving your field packs in a small training shed. Try to do it fast and you violate 1-metre rules. Do it slowly and you will be yelled at for being slow. What a conflict of orders, but it can't be helped.  

Being the first batch to be affected by COVID-19, we got to see how policies kept changing and everything was experimental. Last Parades (the final congregation of everyone to announce the timetable for tomorrow) would first be conducted at a section-level. It would then be abolished and brought online/into the bunk, where we were personally delivered the routine order at our comfort. It then shifted to the company level, where the entire company would assemble on the first floor (taking an absurd amount of space) and the timetable would be announced over the microphone.

How the activities were affected was also very interesting. First Parade completely disappeared from the timetable. I'm not even sure what is done normally, but I'll never know first-hand. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner timings would vary so hard, given how half the seats in the cookhouse disappeared. Towards the second half of my BMT, the number of out-rations we would get, eating it at our company instead of our cookhouse became absurd. Well, can't really blame them if the cookhouse seats halves and the number of recruits doubles (03/20 batch started their BMT). Conducts (such as Physical Training or Live Firing) would occur in 2 waves. Platoons 1 and 2 would do the activity, while Platoons 3 and 4 wait out in bunks, and then vice-versa.

Given how my BMT duration was cut due to the Circuit Breaker, many things had to be cut from our syllabus as well. This is probably unique to the 02/20 batch as it is not explicitly due to the existence of COVID-19, but because we were affected by the stay-home period. We were unable to throw the hand grenade and attempt the Standard Obstacle Course. Weapon presentation and the graduation parade was extremely underwhelming - being conducted at a platoon-level. Our field camp was shortened to 3 days and 2 nights, and the route march was shortened to 12km. 

I hope that this was an interesting read. Thanks for sticking through. Especially for pre-enlistees or recruits, I'd just like to say that it's a very weird time now and what's happening to the programme is surreal.

This is in line with [WP's manifesto that outlines having a national minimum wage](https://www.wp.sg/manifesto/), and was also [brought up by Dr Jamus Lim during the elections period](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/parliament-jamus-lim-tharman-minimum-wage-13079634).

For me, I am in agreement with the proposal to implement a universal minimum wage. Maybe such a policy was less relevant or important in the past, but today with inequality still visible in society (and probably set to widen due to COVID-19), coupled with steadily rising costs of living, I think a need for universal basic income is more important now than ever, [especially to protect the 400 000 Singaporeans who live on $5 a day](https://borgenproject.org/top-10-poverty-in-singapore-facts/) (as claimed by Borgen Project).

Yet, as I support the idea of a minimum wage, I see the need to caution fellow supporters not to adopt an absolutist perspective on the issue. Students who take humanities (especially economics, which is most relevant to minimum wage), will know that 99% it's best not to make sweeping or definitive statements. Don't be so quick to discount the other side, and at least make the effort to recognise the arguments made by other camp. I see a number of social media users trying to take some sort of high ground by saying that such matters are ""pure and simple"", or that policy X is ""the only way"".

2. Cancelling of mass gatherings

4. Getting people to stay home

However, the CB has kicked in starting from today and the focus has shifted to getting people to stay at home, which in my opinion is a much better preventive method than the ""1m apart rule"".

# In this post, I question the mentality of using the ""1m apart rule"" as the main justification of selfish public actions.

Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can travel at least 4.5m away[\[1\]](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay), normal speech also yields large quantities of viral particles[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38808-z).

The following [MIT article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852) states that not only sneezes, and coughs can produce a 'turbulent gas cloud' of viral particles but also normal expiration(breathing) :

&gt;*""Although such social distancing strategies are critical in the current time of pandemic, it may seem surprising that the current understanding of the routes of host-to-host transmission in respiratory infectious diseases are predicated on a model of disease transmission developed in the 1930s that, by modern standards, seems overly simplified. Implementing public health recommendations based on these older models may limit the effectiveness of the proposed interventions.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Recent work has demonstrated that exhalations, sneezes, and coughs not only consist of mucosalivary droplets following short-range semiballistic emission trajectories but, importantly, are primarily made of a multiphase turbulent gas (a puff) cloud that entrains ambient air and traps and carries within it clusters of droplets with a continuum of droplet sizes ""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Peak exhalation speeds can reach up to 33 to 100 feet per second (10-30 m/s), creating a cloud that can span approximately 23 to 27 feet (7-8 m). ""*

We also know that the virus can survive in aerosol for up to 3 hours, plastic and stainless steel for 72 hours, cardboard for 24 hours and copper for 4 hours[\[3\]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v2.full.pdf).

Searching for journal articles presenting data on the effectiveness of the ""1m apart rule"" yielded nothing. Most of the social distancing articles talked about closing schools, banning gatherings and getting people to stay at home[\[4\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372334/) [\[5\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3226987/) [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291415/)[\[7\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-9-117).

I found a [1970s OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Act](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/influenza_pandemic.html) that suggests a 2m apart rule, and the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) that suggests a 1m apart rule:

&gt;**Maintain social distancing**  
&gt;  
&gt;Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Why?** When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Both sources seem to be badly outdated given what we know with the latest research.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif akqjle6v6dr41...*

**In conclusion, I suggest that the ""1m apart rule"" combined with mask wearing should not be taken as the first and most important method of reducing spread, but instead to be taken as a last resort method to protect yourself in the case of emergencies where you will be encountering people in a public area (E.g. buying of groceries when you run out). The most important and effective strategy is to stay at home and limit contact.**",,"Have we as a nation been understanding ""Social distancing"" wrongly?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fwhi08/have_we_as_a_nation_been_understanding_social/

In order to maintain order in our society, news reports detailing the arrests and charges of CB breakers shd serve 2 purposes

In the CNA example, the woman 'teared up' and said that she was desperate because she needed to pay for her mother's cancer bills.

Regardless of reporting, I think that the charges itself would have sufficed. Yes, she was irresponsible in her act but no, if she is fined once it is almost clear that the cost outweighs the benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Dissuading other idiots from performing the act

In this case, I really do not understand how broadcasting the names and histories of people involved helps this. For one, idiots will always be idiots. Also, if we want to punish someone harshly to make an example of them, yes we can do that, but why do we need to unnecessarily subject them to public humiliation, when it is likely to have little impact on their likelihood of re-offending?

&amp;#x200B;

The woman in the CNA report apparently runs a hair salon, which presumably now has its business reputation forever tarnished because of this report, since customers might not want to associate themselves with a 'sex worker'.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, publiation of her face + name only goes to compound the misery of this person, who now has a black mark against her name and will find it hard to find employment anywhere from now on, much less business customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, when we provide such 'insightful details' in our news reportings, are we really trying to 'maintain social order', or are we dishing out punishments which exceed the crime and ruining people's lives just for the sake of some justice boners?

&amp;#x200B;

I am definitely not trying to defend the actions of these people. They were irresponsible, yes. But does it mean that we are going to condemn them for life? Just because we have the means (financial, emotional etc) to survive this CB period does not mean that we should condemn and humiliate others who might be less of than us.

At 14 I got a design that I really liked and I’ve sticked with it till now. (yes 5 years, I still love it) I just didn’t know when I would ever get it.

I know with this Covid situation, tat shops may not open for a few months, but I’m only planning it to get it when tat shops reopen.

hgm2am,1593227747,hgm2am,48,,"To put it simply, I find that all the opposition did during the recent COVID-19 struggle was use everything as an unwarranted excuse to criticize and obstruct the PAP's efforts. Once in a while, one of them would bring up valid feedback during parliament but that was like once in a while and in the end, it was the PAP who put in the work to take care of everyone and address every development. You have to give credit where it is due because they have significantly reduced everyone's burdens as much as they could. And I also say unwarranted excuse because even just during the past week, some opposition members running for office have been breaking post circuit breaker measures like the social distancing practice. Like, can you not?? What's with the double standards..

I find it confusing.. People want change but being someone who has lived in Malaysia (during my childhood) being well known for political drama, I find that if everyone really wants change, then expect all the previous benefits to disappear because it is a new person from a different party ruling and there are many examples historically that indicate massive changes that people regret. If not, expect significant changes to some policies and consider if your neighborhood will continue receiving improvements. I live in Yishun so I cannot say for every other GRC but to me, I'm happy. Since the last GE, new hospital buildings, new polyclinic, more shopping centres, new bus interchange, new MRT station, industrial areas are running strong etc. It's kind of mindblowing that I have met Singaporeans who don't understand that and end up being the ones regretting.

ima1e0,1599196572,ima1e0,48,,"Hi, I see a problem brewing in our job markets. This has not related to which nationality is in finance sectors.

When covid struck, a lot of people lost their jobs and turned to joining food deliveries/SgUnited jobs or rather gig economy, and most sgunited jobs seems to be another thinly veiled gig economy job with a fixed pay structured

But I generally feel this is not permanent solution, for example, when CBD is fully opened up and people goes back to work, there will be very little demand for food deliveries. 

And when the various job support schemes ends, there will be very little positions available to reflect market sentiment considering the rest of the world also low demand. 

Combining these two, we’ll have a relatively large number of people who are looking for jobs paying between $2-3k in the year 2021. That coupled with ending of all the other support schemes and potential gst increase. 

Not to mention, up north, due to them suffering more or less the same strain on their economy, they’ll be coming sg to look for jobs. 

There a few restrictions I see from this:
- as the issue is us having an excess work force, pay cuts will be expected, but it beats no income at all right?

- some solutions will be short term (3-5 years) as when the world fully recovers, market forces will put things back in place.

- no need to shy away from protectionist policies, these are tough times, other countries also are doing it. Countries with little infrastructures/resources/opportunities will see their locals going abroad to seek them. 

I would like to propose a few solutions for these things I’ve just fear-mongered:

1) bring back call centers: these are short term but definitely longer term than sgunited. They can be housed in old schools or closed malls (eg: big box in jurong), try our best to attract companies to set up call centers here. Due to costs involved, it doesn’t seem to be very effective to set up manufacturing capabilities. 

2) repurpose skillsfuture to teach blue-collared skills. This is very sustainable long term, it gives us a proper skill to keep and earn from. These skills also ensure we can sustain ourselves in war-time (ability to repair vehicles compared to excel macros). Encourage locals to take up both white collar and blue collar skills (I took up courses in BCA for plumbing awhile back, I’m in the finance sector)

3) start ups don’t have to be tech all the time, maybe can emphasize more on blue collar jobs and businesses surrounding that. 

4) this is tricky, but make hdb depreciate rather than appreciate. Living space is not investments and like old t shirts, it should be depreciating. Property investors can stick to private/commercial/industrial properties. Or rather, prevent the use of cash for all hdb/bank mortgage for hdb so that people will not overspend (can pay doesn’t mean can afford). 

5) the reason I keep mentioning blue collar is because, for many Singaporeans, driving taxi seems to be the only blue collar job that most fall back on, there can be more. Just renovating a house alone will require many blue collared jobs. Of course, cost will go up due to local labourers being costlier, but I think it’s doable from the savings had from not having to spend cash on hdb flats.

Btw, having a strong and sustainable (meaning future generations also have to take part) blue collared work force will reduce our reliance on foreign workers.

The above points are shortened so that it isn’t divine comedy length. Do discuss what other ways you see can this be improved or tell me how am I wrong?

jiad7x,1603697823,jiad7x,48,,"Firstly, I want to say that this is my own doing and fault and I am not blaming anyone but myself at the mess I am in. 

Backstory/Context: A graduate from a local polytechnic 2.5 years ago in IT. Currently working in an Indian MNC. Applied for a role for a technology that I have never had work experience on in DEC 2019. Was assigned a project for stat board but stayed inhouse. Nothing much to do but reading documentation and just burning time. A month later, the company had the classroom training for two months. Did e-learning at the start on the front end and back end technologies. Flew in a trainer from India to conduct classroom lessons. It was fine until the training ended. Assigned another team but same stat board. New manager and new colleagues. I was only junior there. Had no working laptop. So had to request local machine thru support. COVID happened. Had nothing to do for a month. I was just getting paycheck monthly. Managed to get a machine on mid-APR. Was hospitalised for two weeks and another break for two weeks. Had to install software remotely and was given a task. Problem is that I didn’t know how to do and decided to seek help from a senior developer. So this issue from JUN-SEP was a problem. To sum it up, my senior was not very helpful and I quote “Can you just google for a solution”. Manager barely gives a shit. I was not happy and I just play the bochup game. I rarely attend daily meetings or give updates on my work. Soon enough on mid-September, it was escalated and HR was involved. They gave me the PIP on OCT and manager gave me another difficult task. My PIP ends on 14 NOV. 

Right now I just feel demotivated and feel alone and anxiety and it affects my mental health. I just feel like I barely learn anything over here. I understand that I’m just below average or mediocre. 

I decided to pursue something else. I asked on a random discussion earlier and was looking to the PM/BA role but I hold just a diploma and working experience on web and IT support. I am looking into certifications but it’s expensive (Have to upfront then can claim) and I don’t hold any savings. I won multiple awards in school for pitching and IT competitions. I actually enjoy interacting with clients and prefer a front end role. People tell me I have a knack for strategy and ideation. Everyone keeps saying that software dev is the future and pays really well but I never truly am happy or good at it at all. It’s just the salary that keeps me going. 

To top it off, I have put myself into credit card debt a year ago due to bad financial decisions (I am undergoing for consolidation with a MinLaw but the requirement is a full-time job) and was hospitalised diabetic (Under subsidised care so cost is lowered). So 2020 wasn’t a good year. 

I feel helpless and I don’t know what to do. I wished I can turn the clock and reset my decisions but I know I cannot. I don’t want to give up and I just want to move on.  

I may have left some details out. Please let me know. Also in my contract, it says I have 60 days to announce notice but if I have misconduct, I can be immediately terminated without pay.",,Feeling helpless and lost.

gap02v,1588221128,gap02v,50,,"Hi guys,

Got a bit of a dilemma on my hands and thought I could crowdsource some opinions.

I'm a Y3 student in FASS who's been thinking of graduating at the end of Y3 (no honours) for some time now. Why? I felt that having an honours makes little difference in my selected field and I believe experience counts for more, so I made up my mind that the opportunity cost of studying for honours was too high. Well, up until this corona hit.

I've been job hunting since January and I am lucky to have managed to get a job offer in my field for an okay salary (non-pandemic-depressed wage). If I accept, I'll start work soon and not do honours. I know what you're thinking, so what's the issue right? Lucky bastard got a job in this economy. However, I have some worries about the two options I have right now so I'll list them out and hopefully the more experienced members here can guide me a little:

OPTION 1: TAKE THE JOB

PROS:
- I get income, experience and a headstart over my peers in the field

CONS:

- Without an honours, I will not be able to enter government service, thereby closing the door on those career options in the future (not sure how true)

- Worry that I might get laid off before the end of 1 year and be left without honours and without a job (no one knows what could happen).

OPTION 2: TAKE HONOURS

PROS:
- Still have my options to work in the government service open
- Come out of the pandemic next year with better job prospects (hopefully)

CONS:
- Spend at least $10k this year on tuition/living fees while forgoing $30k+ in opportunity cost for not working

i59va1,1596787465,i59va1,50,,"SMEs tend to get a bad reputation more often than not, and I thought I might just share some perspectives and observations of the general SME industries (manufacturing, engineering) as a whole, coming from an SME family myself. Disclaimer though, I have a full time corporate job myself but I do help out in the business in a less active role. 

It goes without saying that COVID has had a major impact on many businesses both big and small. A trial by fire in a sense, with companies slow to adapt to new circumstances being forced to close down. Unfortunately, there's not too much that can be done about the travel industry though. 

The sad truth for many SMEs I've observed is that there's no real value proposition in their businesses. Alot of it is based on a first mover advantage and paired with suppressing down costs with cheap foreign labour and you get quite substantial profits with a largely average product offering. The golden years of SME are by far over with increasing foreign levies and quotas, as well as increasing market saturation. 

It is easy for one to say, innovate and adapt but the reality is far more bleak than that. Many of these sectors are sunset industries and for quite a number of manufacturing sectors, substantial investments from one's reserves will be needed to upgrade machinery/automation without much guarantee of success. I think one factor that has hit the industry particularly hard has been the restrictions on foreign workers' quota, and honestly it is something that irks me as well, with the government going as far as to say that this is in line with what the people have requested. Well for one, I'm pretty sure that the demands for less foreigners are geared towards white collar jobs (foreign talents) rather than blue collar ones. We haven't received any local applications for our jobs in ages and it's laughable to think that this whole ""foreigners taking away jobs"" applies to sectors like engineering, manufacturing and construction. There are ways that some companies go by to get around this that aren't exactly legal but those are definitely not sustainable in the longer run. 

To be objective, if one’s value proposition is indeed low costs simply by large scale usage of foreign labour then the cruel truth is indeed that time is up. However, a part of me is left like perhaps a sour taste in the mouth after seeing all these fanciful announcements of governmental aid through various subsidies and schemes. Looks good on paper but terrible for application and borrowing an old uncle’s cliché, ‘drafted by scholars with no understanding of how things on the ground are’. An example of this would be software subsidies for certain categories that are of little use for many companies due to very specific needs and the wordings of such dictate that other programs outside of this category but with similar purposes would fall out of this scheme’s coverage.

Another trumpeting sound of doom would be worker retention which is a problem for SMEs as well. While we are in a largely niche area, we do compete with some large MNCs in some other sectors and the sad truth is that we are unable to match their pay and benefits. Before one draws their pitchforks and says that is the result of underpaying foreign workers, I am pretty certain we pay almost 30% more than other SME competitors and even more for top workers. It is possible to draw down more on the margins to match that of the MNCs for our top workers but definitely not a large scale increase across the board. In addition, job opportunities there are much better in comparison to ours and we do wish them the best in their new career path. The main problem lies with worker replacement given the pain of the whole administrative process and now with closed borders due to Covid. I would go as far as to say we are defenceless if the big MNCs come by on a poaching hunt until travel restrictions are eased and WPs are getting issued again. 

Personally, I feel that as the saying goes, “fortune favours the bold” and the future of many sectors would be to look to shift their facilities/factories offsite overseas. It is definitely a huge costly investment and certainly out of reach for many smaller scale businesses, but I don’t really see much of an alternative to the slow decay over here. And it also definitely comes with its risk. I know of fellow business owners who set up facilities in China only to have their patents/ideas copied and cannibalized. Good luck trying to take any legal action over there. And for other parts of Southeast Asia, protection of businesses and their rights are not as developed. 

For many other businesses that lack the capacity and reserves, the most common path that I’ve seen would be to squeeze out as much profit margins as possible before calling it a day. That means no reinvestment of company profits but that is probably the safest and most conservative approach one can take. Of course, there are also many owners scrambling as such an approach is nowhere near feasible for them given their overleveraged purchases (7 series, landed etc). Those, I have little pity for. It is just downright stupid to assume that one’s earnings from a self-owned business can be sustained for perpetuity. One such business owner is now far behind in his debt to us and debt collection can be a real pain in the ass. Assuming you even go to the trouble of getting things pushed through court and you do win the case, execution of the court’s order is another thing altogether. There are one too many cases of subcontractors being screwed over in the middle of a big project because someone down the line has fallen.

I do think that in the near term, we will be seeing a lot of consolidation in various sectors and that will go some length in improving inefficiencies in the industry through a survival of the fittest. Alas, there will be those that will just be forgotten and left behind. On the bright side for us, a very frugal mindset and attitude means that there’s little to sigh about for an early retirement for my folks.

PS to that fellow business owner uncle who’s in deep shit and who always bugs my dad to buy a 7 series for the status: A Toyota Camry is really above average already and is 130-140k? A BMW 7 series is 600k? If you have deep pockets, by all means go ahead lah.

the dorscon is orange now, and i guess the public's first reaction is to clear the ntuc shelfs!! like ""oh my god, there's some spread among the community now and i dont want to get the virus!! i better buy as much food as i can in case it runs out!!!!!"" yeah, im pretty sure supermarkets enjoy the business right now. 

i mean i guess i understand why people are paranoid about this situation, like i sort of am too, i wash my hand with that 7 steps everytime now lol? and i try to touch less things in public, and i bring hand sanitzer where i go (btfw i had it long before the virus was a thing, so im not one of those that clears stock thank you very much) but is it necessary to be this paranoid???

i think it's disgusting, it's selfish, it's posessive. it tells me that these people only care about themself and probably their family but no one else. it tells me that they dont care about others needs, they don't care that there are also people who may need it more than them. that they think for only themselves. 

technically ""we're supposed to be there for one another. and help each other out within the community and people living in the same country!!!"" but i guess that's just a lie in this case. it's almost funny because this is plain irony, or how i like to see it as some sort of sick humour. 

it makes me sick that this is the behaviour of people now. i really don't get it. don't they feel embarrassed? have they got no ounce of self respect and dignity left in them? the queues in my neighborhood supermarket is longer than i have ever seen on a regular day, and i assume that it is too for most parts of the country now. am i the only sane one or am i insane??? 

oh and don't get me started on people taking advantage of the situation by selling at really high prices. it's s i c k e n i n g. yes i know the demand is high, yes i know you can say it's business strategy, whatever. yes it's normal to sell at a higher price, of course to make more profit and money for youself. but selling at really high prices that are unrealistic??? r e a l l y? it's disgusting too. 

to those hoarding food and items and those selling at really high prices, i hope you take a huge step back and take a breather. i don't think this is on intention, but i really think it'd be amazing if you realise what you're doing and the kind of obsessive and selfish behaviour this is. and to those who are doing it intentionally, great job to making yourself look horrible!!

i'm only 16 but if this is the message the public wants to give off - be possessive, obsessive, selfish, till the point that it's so off putting, then so be it. i guess the younger generations should learn it too right? actions still speak louder than words anyway. and if we live through this and the virus dies down, (and im only saying ""if"" because everyone is acting as if it's the end of the world and this behavior is totally necessary, so might as well believe it right!!! lol) i bet that this issue will appear in social studies in the next few years or so. so great job, i hope that this issue is fondly remembered and the next few generations will learn about this really disgusting behaviour and get the message.

To Singaporeans: do not make us go down.

Currently we are able to tide things through using whatever financial budget that Singapore has. Easing on payments, giving out stimulus and every other measures. The government has tried pumping in a lot of resources into all these tests, stay home notices and other measures. 

This is not a long term solution for us Singaporeans. Throwing money into the pit to try and slow down the spread.

 'Gahment so much money, can one la'. Of course Singapore can spend this much money but that doesn't mean we should be spending it. Cause these money is from all of us, saved up and spent wisely. 

The government is doing their best in their own ways to resolve this problem. But as long as Singaporeans continue to act irresponsibly, this situation will either become A) we run out of resources B) we can kiss our stability as a nation goodbye.

&gt;  
&gt;Most students have both online and physical lessons in a single day with little breaks in-between, so students are forced to come to campus for their online lessons because their travel time &gt; break time.

Reason being that the overly bureaucratic nature of such an organisation would hinder the process of getting information to NTU administration effectively and swiftly. I have emailed NTUSU about the issue, but I have yet to receive a reply.

I am part of a mineral collecting club. Once or twice a year we have meet-ups where we discuss about minerals and trade with each other. That means we basically have thousands of dollars worth of minerals strewn over the floor and table

Despite that, we posted things like: ""Children are welcome! Let's get them exposed to this hobby from young!"" So far, every child who has ever showed up were either well-behaved, or were sternly told by their parents not to play with any of the minerals so we never found the need to declare a no-child policy.

Also, some kids were impressed at all the minerals and allowed to handle some as long as they were careful

During this meet-up last year however, a newcomer mother came with an 8-year old boy. As we were sitting down and bartering with one another, the kid grabbed two minerals worth several hundred and whacked them against each other. The owner damn near had a heart-attack. Later on, as the mother went to the kitchen to buy/admire more minerals, her boy grabbed my expensive mineral and ran around the house. I took chase and literally had to wrestle the mineral out of his hands

The kid went into a room, and soon after I heard a yelp from another adult. I presume the kid tried to touch or grab something expensive.

His mother was apologetic. She implied that his father wasn't available to watch him and she loved minerals so she came to this meet-up. Another mineral collector (the one whose minerals were grabbed) then told her sternly: If he destroys anything, you are buying it

They stayed for another 30 mins before leaving because the son was obviously bored out of his mind and would have grabbed at more minerals if not for the adults watching him closely or even outright swatting his hands away when he tried to touch something

That episode has left a fear of kids in me. It's my turn to host the next mineral meet-up next year if Covid-19 improves

frlt0z,1585550339,frlt0z,52,,"**DISCLAIMER: I'd first like to start out by pointing out that this is in no way a rant, but rather an open invitation to regulars, civilians and NSFs alike to discuss views on the SAFs response to COVID-19. I am an NSF serving my second year into NS.

With the inevitable approach of DORSCON Red impending, the government has already started imposing public measures in order to slow down the rate of the spread of the virus. However, I feel that the lackluster response of the SAF is a cause for concern.

Let me just clarify that as I'm typing this during my lunch break in the cookhouse, I am eating alongside 500 or so personnel congregated within the confines of one roof.

Sure, there has been some measures put into place such as the 1-metre social distancing and daily temperature taking, but what is social distancing if everyone is in close quarters to one another? What is social distancing if everyone shares the same bunks and toilets? What is social distancing if the canteen operator that serves us food and the storeman at the armstoke are the same people that serves every other individual in camp? What is social distancing if men are still crammed together in the same Tonner for training? I think you guys get the point.

I once asked my superiors what would happen in the event that the pandemic does not cease, but only got more serious. Apparently, with accordance to the procedures done in the preceding SARS outbreak, SAF camps will go into lockdown, and all personnel will be confined within their respective camps. The rationale behind this is that is to minimise movement outside of camps in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

Here is the point I want to highlight; isn't there already more than enough people in camps already? Forced attendance in camps have already led to an excess in manpower. Many NSFs just come to camp to zhuobo, so what's the point in keeping everyone in? All it accomplishes is unnecessary exposure to people who do not have to be there in the first place. All it takes is one carrier of the virus to book in, and soon camps around Singapore will become a cesspit for the virus.

""But bro, I last time SARS also kena confined why you complain?"" ""But everyone plays an integral role  in defending the beuracracy of Singapore"" And all like-statements are irrelevant if most of the men in my camp are laying face-up on their bunk beds glued to their phones waiting for further instructions that never comes. If the govt can say that ""people should stay at home unless absolutely necessary"", then who are we as the sons of the same people to be forced to come to camp for the sake of ""serving our duty"". No more than 10 people are allowed to be tgt for social gatherings, but it's ok for twice the amount to be sardine-canned into a shared bunk in between trainings in waves of battalion?

So here are my suggested solutions:

1. Staggered shifts, where men rotate duties in camp to reduce the population density in camp. There will be reduced movement in and out of camps.

2. Community service for the NSFs. Much like the mask packing operation, why not use the men in order to carry out operations islandwide? This services could range from disinfecting of public places, ushering of citizens at crowded public transport interchanges, or assisting to delivery of necessary supplies to needy families affected by SHN. All of these would help to spread-thin the density of the SAF population, all while providing a service to the country in sectors where manpower may be needed. 

Of course, I acknowledge that these hypothetical solutions also pose their problems, which I'm open to discussing in the comments section so as to not make this post too lengthy. At the end of the day, I still feel this is far better than unnecessary exposure to a denser population for military personnel.",,An open discussion about the SAF during the COVID-19 period,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/frlt0z/an_open_discussion_about_the_saf_during_the/

ga2ld0,1588133649,ga2ld0,52,," 3,000 former healthcare professionals have also come back to take on their previous roles, but more manpower is required.

People from ""all walks of life"" are being asked to volunteer for  Singapore's healthcare system in combating Covid-19, in response to the  growing need for additional manpower.

Non-healthcare professionals welcome  
The appeal for volunteers is for those a without healthcare background as well.

""In fact, all are welcome,"" health minister Gan Kim Yong said at an Apr.  28 press conference, adding that ""going forward, we'll need a lot more  help from people, and I think it's good for Singaporeans to step  forward.""

SG Healthcare Corps  
 Gan said that ""people from all walks of life"" could sign up on the SG  Healthcare Corps portal. The SG Healthcare Corps was launched on Apr. 7,  and sought help from healthcare professionals such as nurses, to be on  standby to support those in Covid-19 related operations.

These volunteers would then be matched up with available roles and given the required training packages.

Roles which volunteers might play  
 Non-healthcare workers could be involved in administrative and support  roles, the health ministry’s Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak  said at a technical briefing on Apr. 28.

This would free up healthcare professionals who currently carry out  those tasks, allowing them to be deployed to frontline roles where they  would help to manage Covid-19 patients.

Skillsets will be matched, training provided  
 Mak explained that there would be a process to match volunteers' skillsets to existing needs.

Mak also said that specific training packages would be provided, to make  sure that volunteers would be able to perform their roles competently.

More healthcare professionals still needed  
 Mak said that around 3,000 healthcare professionals have signed up to  join the SG Healthcare Corps since it was launched on Apr. 7.

This includes former healthcare professionals who pursued a second  career outside of healthcare, and who have now come back to take on  their previous roles.

It also includes some who have come back out of retirement, as well as those from the private sector, Mak said.

Mak also asked for more healthcare workers to sign up, in order to fill  roles such as forming swab testing teams, to support medical teams  deployed to dormitories to care for foreign workers.

Healthcare workers might not be doing their ""normal jobs""  
 Mak explained that healthcare workers who volunteered might not be doing  their ""normal jobs"", citing the example of dentists who are currently  deployed in swab testing teams, due to the fact that they were  well-trained in the use of personal protective equipment.

Additional manpower required for new facilities  
 The call for volunteers arises from additional manpower requirements at various ""expanded healthcare facilities"", Mak said.

These expanded facilities, including the Community Care Facilities  (CCFs) at D’Resort, Singapore EXPO, and Changi Exhibition Centre, are  used to house the rapidly rising numbers of Covid-19 patients.

Besides CCFs, recovering Covid-19 patients may now be transferred to  Community Recovery Facilities (CRFs), Brigadier-General David Neo  announced at the press conference on Apr. 28.

So here in this sub and in general all across social media there're a lot of condemnation pointed towards people who are hoarding/stockpiling. We see pictures of people selling mask at higher prices, aiming to get a profit out of this, and we see empty shelves in supermarket due to panic buying and hoarding of food items and for some reason tissue papers.

gxr5kz,1591450733,gxr5kz,53,,"Some brief background about me: I am a 19yo currently serving NS. I entered NS with a PES B1 status but struggled with anxiety issues for a while and have been seing a psychiatrist, from whom I received a memo just in case of any issues in camp. Told my platoon commander about it and after discussion I decided to carry on with the basic training as my symptoms had been in remission for a while.

I decided that the probability of me entering into a frontline vocation that might worsen my mental health condition was significant, and also felt some recurrence of anxiety midway through the training, so I decided to hand my memo over to the doctor in the medical centre. Placed on light duty until training was disrupted by Covid, and now awaiting posting to a non-frontline vocation.

I wrote this post because I just wanted to share my experiences and encourage those who are currently in NS and struggling with past or current mental health conditions. Ok so here goes:

Most people weren't hostile to me, they just didn't understand.

So the response of most of my platoonmates after I went to the medical centre went along the lines of ""you look fine, I didn't know you had this problem"". Thankfully I didn't receive any verbal abuse from anyone in my platoon, they are all great people with whom I shared great memories with. Nonetheless, some probably didn't know how to react knowing my condition, and may have some preconceived mindset of people with mental health conditions being ""violent, unpredictable and dangerous"" and so interacted with me far less than before. I totally understand why they did that and don't blame them at all. But hopefully through my actions of kindness I can change their perception of people with mental health struggles.

Some people gave well-intentioned advice but it did get on my nerves after a while.

I heard from my family members constant advice not to report my condition in NS, in case a downgraded PES status affects my job prospects in future. Definitely, that has to be considered for those considering working in the civil service, but for me, such advice was often given with the implicit statement that my mental health issues are somehow not as real or as damaging as a physical condition. Which honestly made me rather irritated. But maybe I'm just reading too much into it. But anyways, my advice would be to always prioritise health over wealth. Those who have suffered from mental health issues know how awful the experience can be during the darkest moments.

I think some people looked down on me because of my condition, but I won't let that bother me.

Especially some of the sirs and sergeants, who have this mentality that being a ""man"" means having big muscles and being aggressive and brave. To them, having anxiety issues is a weakness. In response, I quote a character from my favourite fictional show: ""if you know pain and hardship, it's easier to be kind to others. It is different from weakness"". A true ""man"" (or ""woman"") is one who can show kindness to others. And for us who have struggled with mental health issues, we have developed a bravery and resilience of a different sort, and I would say, a better sort than the gung-ho heroism of some men. Because while we are resilient in the face of our own struggles, we learn how to be kind to others, as we know that a smiling face can hide many personal struggles and battles. ""Be kind to others, as everyone is fighting his own battles""

And also, there are certainly many healthy people who use mental health issues as a means to ""chao keng"", and this gives us a bad name. But I don't let that affect me. People can think whatever they want about me. Definitely I want to find people who can understand and emphatise with my situation, but I'm not going around begging for sympathy. And I won't let some people's harsh comments affect me.

I expect this post to get some nasty comments. To my brothers in NS who have also struggled, or are struggling with, mental health conditions, my advice for you would be to throw such comments out of the window. And to those who are afraid of declaring their conditions, my advice is to always protect your health, even if it means ""losing face"". Because if you lose your health, you lose everything. Do what you deem best for yourself.

jvvizd,1605628917,jvvizd,55,,"So, uh, I’m choosing to post this here as I feel that having people familiar with our culture/behaviour will understand more about where I’m coming from

I work in a HR office at a huge company as a temp. Due to covid, the office of 20 is split into two teams, A and B, with each team coming to the office for two days (Mon, Tues and Thurs, Fri.) Wednesdays are WFH. I’m the sole exception and come in every day for misc duties like filing and stuff. 

Team A is chill. Made up of older women and a few early twenties adults. I enjoy working with them a lot.

Team B is made up of middle aged (think 30s) people, and also a few young adults. And team B ‘bullies’ one of the ladies on a daily basis

In B, there’s a clique made up of the middle aged ladies. They’re good at their jobs, and are nice to me. I personally have no grudge towards them and find them funny as well. But I see them verbally abuse one of the ladies, P - scolding her for not doing her job, not to beat around the bush, speak faster, why is she asking stupid questions, etc etc. It’s obviously clear that they’re targeting her alone, and I’m feeling a bit of frustration at myself regarding this

The thing is, P is nice. Sweet in a way, but I will admit that she is air-headed and often talks around the bush in a way that may be irritating to people rushing for time (and in HR they’re pretty much rushing all the time). She’s the richest in the office as well, and likes to share with me about her vacations and ‘rich people activities’. I don’t like to assume that she’s ‘showing off’, so I just go along with it and be friendly to her. Besides, it’s not everyday I get to see what exactly is inside a 5-star hotel in Greece and the size of lobster they serve. Her experience is interesting to me.

According to Team B, they’re irritated at P as she is unable to keep up with the workload and tends to forget whatever she’s learnt, therefore she wasting the team’s valuable time when they barely have it. I personally have not witnessed that, so I just took it with a grain of salt.

The point is, due to past experiences I have learnt a lesson in not being a sheep and believe anything anyone says until I’ve seen it with my own two eyes. So I do not join in with the ‘bullying’, but I keep to myself when it happens. And thinking about it today is making me feel disgusted and frustrated at myself for what I’m doing. On one hand, I don’t want to be a bystander to bullying. On the other, I firmly believe in minding my own business when I don’t have full facts to both side of the story. I don’t really want to start a fight with anyone either by meddling in.

This is my review of the action. All views are my own. And all statements are opinions.

Without further ado, lets dive into the PSP. The PSP is probably the least known of the parties. For the PSP, I am surprised at how well they handled themselves at the debate. Mr yuen is actually a very knowledgable person when it comes to labour issues and business issues, having worked in china for quite a number of years. The points brought across by the PSP are surprisingly refreshing. It is just unfortunate that the party (for now) is mostly about rhetoric. It is pretty clear that their positions on issues were built in a thinking box without really considering numbers and externalities. Nonetheless, they have brought across that they are not a meaningless opposition. They remind me of the platform that LTK ran on in 2011.

Next up, Dr Chee. Dr Chee, Dr Chee, how do I even begin. I am honestly rather disappointed with his performance. But let me first address the points brought across in this debate. SDP as always have brought the policies to politics. Exactly what matters for the future of Singapore. Issues such as suspending the GST, addressing overpopulation, and reducing the reliance on foreign workforce are pertinent to the long term success of our economy. Unlike other parties, SDP has stood by these messages long before they surfaced as national issues. Long gone are the days where increasing the number of workers in the economy is a sufficient measure to improve GDP numbers, and SDP hits right at its core. Now, the problem is Mr chee still has a bone to pick with the PAP. What he has forgotten is that it has been eons, EONS since he was sued by the PAP. And politics has changed since then. Personal attacks and below the belt accusations are not things that the electorate want to see. I feel for Mr Chee, he is doing what he knows best, playing the politics of the 90s, while bringing forth excellent questions to the government. I would vote for him, he would have my vote any day. Just.. please... to win sir, leave the ""F to PAP"" behind.

What an amazing outing by Jamus, could not have expected anything more from him! He has a clear understanding of the WPs manifesto, probably written largely in consultation with himself. A macroeconomist by training, with over 20 years in policy formation, we would not expect otherwise. The ex-minister asked Jamus if WP was simply taking all of PAPs positions and shifting one foot left. To this he responded that there was nothing wrong with improving social support if it did not put the government into a deficit. While some may take issue with budget neutrality, he shows us exactly where WP stands without agreeing with Vivian. He then asked the minister if the government had actually known what they were doing with their covid economic policies. This is an important one, having dipped multiple times into the reserve, it leaves one to wonder if the government was simply pumping cash into a leaking boat. With much grace, the ex-minister chose very wisely to dodge this question. With one perfect answer and one perfect question, Jamus shows Singaporeans why WP should be placed on equal footing with the PAP during this elections.

A former golden boy of the PAP and an award winning debator, Vivian, used his time wisely. With 3 times the time allocated to the PAP, Vivian was able to focus in energies on the WP and SDP, somewhat engaging them in a policy debate. Otherwise, the bulk of what the ex-minister did was hand waving away questions or repeating the government policy tag lines. This is not unexpected since PAPs policy position is well known to the populace through their actual policies. Taking the bait from Dr Chee, Vivian adopted the position of the best defence is screaming fake news. This is unfortunate, coming from an ex-minister, as we know the only real defence to fake news is to give us the facts. If Dr Chee's positions are indeed fake news, I look forward to POFMA being invoked in the coming days. Following Dr Chee's bait, Vivian decided to drop some bait himself, asking Jamus if the WP was indeed, a PAP lite on policy positions. This of course is not an easy question to answer but was taken well by Jamus without missing a beat.

So who won? The WP certainly scored the most points with me, followed by the PAP. With SDP lagging only slightly behind - due to Dr. chee's outdated politicking. PSP has much room to grow. Despite having experienced candidate Dr Tan on their roster, he brings little more than ground work experience. They need to realise that party views, positions and policies are also key issues during an election and not mere taglines.",,CNA's First Election Debate: My Take.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hjgvhl/cnas_first_election_debate_my_take/

However because of covid no applications are going through and off I get it next year, the conditions for applying for citizenship is that I have to be a pr for at least 1 year before applying. 

That would mean when and if I get citizenship I will be just about 18 and would apply for Singapore national service. But if I don't get citizenship, I have Singapore pr and Korean citizenship and I would be 18, which means I can't cancel my Korean citizenship and I would have to serve both country's national service.

Yes the government did say that they learnt a lot and have made a lot of changes, but seeing how preventive measures over the past week or so were only put in place when things were getting serious and even until now our warning level is only YELLOW and not even ORANGE is certainly not comforting to us citizens at all. The current measures in place is simply not sufficient at the moment and any measures put into place hereafter is probably too late as signs of community spread &amp; outbreak is emerging. Even in schools the measures in place aren't enough to prevent a community outbreak. Are we just going to sit here with our ""lessons learnt"" and go through SARS 2.0, where innocent people die simply because not enough was done in time? 

The mask issue is also another worrying topic. While I do not competent disagree with what the government has been saying about usage of masks, at this current situation are we still supposed to do so? Especially on peak hours trains and buses where I've witnessed so many commuters coughing/sneezing without a mask or covering their mouth/nose, are we still supposed to ""not wear a mask if we're not sick""? Who are we to know that the one coughing is not someone infected?

Even if we decide to wear masks when commuting/in public places, we cannot even get masks now without paying scalpers insane prices for their stocks. Even stores now are upping their prices for masks and I've witnessed people queuing hours just to get them. Other countries have already prohibited increasing of mask prices, what's stopping us from doing the same?

Furthermore, we're being told all along that we don't need that many masks and that we have sufficient supply of masks; yet it's sold out everywhere and we are warned that if we do not use conservatively we would not have enough of a supply. Then why are we only told that we have sufficient supply of masks at the start and why aren't we told under what circumstances we can maintain that sufficient supply?

Sport for the long rant, I'm just really frustrated and afraid of what may possibly happen in the days &amp; weeks to come.

it2z2z,1600149643,it2z2z,57,,"S’porean Buys $2 Meal For Hungry Man Who Asked For Help, Says He Must Have Swallowed Tremendous Pride

The Covid-19 pandemic has caused the world economy to take a hit, and Singapore’s economy hasn’t been spared either.

As we brace ourselves for our worst recession yet, the number of jobless people and retrenchments continue to increase.

For those who may not be affected, sometimes it takes an encounter with an actual needy person for the realisation to hit home that this is really affecting people.

That’s what jolted a Singaporean who shared a Facebook post on Monday (14 Sep), recounting how he spent $2 to buy a meal for a needy man.

### ‘Decent-looking’ man asked for help

On Sunday (13 Sep) morning, netizen Simon Lim was at a row of shops below a HDB block when he was approached by a middle-aged man.

His first impression of the man was that he was “decent-looking”.

So, he might have been a caught off guard when the man said he was hungry and asked if he could pay for his meal.

### Netizen asked a stupid question

In response, Mr Lim blurted out: Why isn’t he working?

He later chided himself for asking what he thought was a “quite stupid” question. During economically challenging times like this, it’s obvious that there would be many people who’re out of a job.

Thus, the netizen agreed to pay for the man’s meal.

They went to a nearby coffee shop where the hungry man ordered 2 *roti prata kosong*.

 

The meal cost just $2, which Mr Lim paid to the stallholder.

### Gave man $2 more for coffee

As the he left the hungry man to his meal, “many thoughts” ran through Mr Lim’s mind, he said.

He was compelled to head back to the coffee shop.

He handed the man another $2, asking him to get himself a cup of coffee.

 

What could have prompted him to make the extra donation?

He put himself in the hungry man’s shoes, and realised that he must have mustered up tremendous courage to ask for such a favour from a stranger.

The man must also have “swallowed tremendous pride” to do it, he added.

### 1st-hand encounter with struggling citizens

The incident humbled him, as he saw 1st hand how some Singaporeans are truly struggling due to the current economic situation.

He wished the man well, saying that at least he was willing to swallow humble pie rather than commit a crime for money.

He concluded that the privileged or well-educated might not see these realities as one doesn’t learn that in books, but it’s important to take the struggles of people to heart.

### An inspiration to us all

While we might all be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in one way or another, it’ll serve us well as a society to remember that such crises often disproportionately affect the less fortunate.

Thus, Mr Lim deserves kudos for helping out someone who’s truly needy.

We hope he inspires all Singaporeans to reach out and help those in need during these economically challenging times.

gasopv,1588239959,gasopv,58,,"Hi, Redditporeans. I tried to post my thoughts on Hardwarezone but for somehow I just couldn't make account so bodoh peh kambing, I'll just write it on Reddit.

I'm sure we all know about that idiot who a few weeks ago, posted that screenshot on HWZ celebrating ""I can't believe this! So simple to cheat!"". Then he got slammed by ministers, and Shanmugam even threaten to arrest him. That guy could have potentially sabo'd a lot of people in desperate need if they actually decided to tighten their vetting process, making it harder to get the TRF money. I heard that guy made an apology post but, tbh I'm not bothered to read it.

Without giving away anything identifiable info about myself, I was a self-employed person who within a few weeks, lost 75% of my income. Then in March my income just completely died. I was back to an unemployed useless NEET (that's a Japanese term), unsuccessfully looking for a job, any job. Of course nobody ever calls back, and with Covid intensifying all hope of getting a job now is lost. 

Yes I know there are a lot of temp jobs that sprung up because of Covid, like temperature screeners. No I still couldn't get a job. I heard from my friend who was hard hit because he works hotel line (he got fired I think) that the govt' had been helping people in the service industry stay employed by plopping them to another work place, like NTUC. Idk if this affects the job seeking prospects of people who aren't working right now... Anyway I'm genuinely not jealous. Good for these people, good for my friend.

But my money situation was getting desperate. I began to entertain the thought of borrowing money from ah longs just to survive - idk even how to do that but if I had to... This was complicated by me basically not having documents to show that I even made an income, which for the past 2 months, I pretty much didn't. I couldn't submit my form at my local CC because the guys there will check through my documents and reject me, tell me to go home to get my papers. I had to apply online. I lost hope and just sent the application, taking it as a pleasant surprise if it happens.

The $500 came. It saved. My. Ass. Then at the same time, another $600. Now I can at least hunker down and survive another month until maybe things get better, and I could find myself a job. I'm out of the crisis for now.

TBH I don't even know if anyone will read this, this post may well get buried in NEW and disappear into the internet. But to the ministers/govt/whoever I'm supposed to direct my gratitude towards, thank you. As perhaps one of the silent majority compared to the 'vocal minority' who tries to sabo people, I feel I should say something. This TRF was exactly what I needed, and I thank heaven that even someone like me who barely qualifies, could receive it. I will not rest on my laurels, I will still work hard to job search, but for now, I am good.

And to the people who take advantage at the expense of others, I won't say ""f*ck you"" to you, just, I hope you can live with your conscience.

Since the CB period started, the government reduced the mowing frequency of our fields and streetscapes. This provided an opportunity for our wild plants to flourish, creating some really spectacular mass blooms around Singapore. Since I kinda want to refresh my plant ID knowledge, I figured I'll do a short write up on the common roadside flowers in Singapore. Hopefully it will get people more interested in the wide diversity of flora we have along our streets and pavements.

So before I start..... **Why are roadside plants so important?** Singapore's strict horticultural standards and obsession of a neat and manicured environment provide little chance for our wild plants to flourish. Wild plants and their flowers provide a very important ecological function for the urban biodiversity. They are able to support insects such as butterflies and grasshoppers, which in turn provide food for larger animals such as birds and reptiles. The trend of reducing mowing frequency of streetscapes have begun to catch on in other [countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-48772448). Hopefully this period of mass blooming can convince the government that our streetscapes don't need to be so neat and ""sterile"" all the time. 

On to the flowers....

[***Asystasia gangetica***](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/1/7/1705) (Subspecies *micrantha*)

* Common name: **Chinese Violet**
* Description: This species is easily recognizable from their white flowers have 5 rounded lobes with a purple marking on the lower lip. It is a hostplant for many butterfly species like the [blue pansy](http://www.butterflycircle.com/checklist/showbutterfly/108) (my favourite species) and the [Jacintha eggfly](http://www.butterflycircle.com/checklist/showbutterfly/103).

&amp;#x200B;

[***Tridax procumbens***](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/5/2530) 

* Common name: **Coat button**
* Description: They are **EVERYWHERE.** They have a daisy-like flower with yellow-green petals and a yellow centre. Their flowers tend to grow singly with a long stem. Butterflies like the [lesser grass blue](http://www.butterflycircle.com/checklist/showbutterfly/221) **LOVE** their flowers for nectar. They are usually considered as a weed as they tend to grow really rapidly. I'm pretty sure you have seen patches of grass just absolutely covered with these guys.

&amp;#x200B;

[***Bidens alba***](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/6/3616)**/**[***pilosa***](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/3/3312)

* Common name: **Beggarticks**
* Description: I think they differ by the number of petals but since they drop all the time, I can never tell. So I'm putting both in since they are relatively common. Their flowers have 4-7 white petals with a yellow centre. Their seeds are really annoying when they get stuck to your shoes/socks/pants as they have a barbed hooks which really hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

[***Elephantopus scaber***](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/5/2/5210)

* Common name: **Elephant's Foot**
* Description: I mean, the plant looks like an elephant's foot or an elephant stepped on it. Its flowers are made of many small florets that purple/pink. In some countries, its supposedly used in traditional medicine to treat fever and bladder stones (**please don't try it**).

&amp;#x200B;

[***Neptunia plena***](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/2/2263)

* Common name: **Water mimosa**
* Description: Like the [mimosa](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/2/2225), its leaves are sensitive to touch and will close. It prefers semi-flooded grassfields, which explains its common name. It has a fluffy, bright yellow, ball-shaped flower which resembles a dandelion.

&amp;#x200B;

[*Emilia sonchifolia*](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/1/9/1986)

* Common name: **Cupid's Shaving Brush**
* Description: Before its blooms, the flower has a vase-like shape with pink/purple florets sticking out from the top. Once the flower mature, it transforms into a white hairy ball.

&amp;#x200B;

[*Cyanthillium cinereum*](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/5/8/5811)

* Common name: **Little Ironweed**
* Description: The growth form of the flower looks almost exactly like *Emilia sonchifolia* BUT the vase-shape is not as prominent. The florets sticking out from the top is white to light purple. Personally, how i differentiate them is by the proportion of florets sticking out from the top. If the proportion for florets is around 40% or more of the flower, its *Cyanthillium cinereum*. If its less than 40%, its *Emilia sonchifolia.* In addition*, Cyanthillium cinereum* doesn't mature into white hairy ball.

&amp;#x200B;

[Cleome rutidosperma](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/1/8/1816)

* Common name: **Fringed spiderflower**
* Description: Its has four pink/purple petals that are side-by-side and are pointed upwards like a fan. Its flowers are relatively small compared to the other flowers on this list. This species is the hostplant for many common butterfly species like the [Striped Albatross](http://www.butterflycircle.com/checklist/showbutterfly/29) and [Cabbage White](http://www.butterflycircle.com/checklist/showbutterfly/35).

However Friday morning he suddenly woke up with a 39.x degree fever. Though he was still pretty much his usual energetic self, his energy faded by mid-morning as the fever raged on without much abatement, staying withing the 38.5-39.5 degree range. After his afternoon nap it hit an all-time high of 39.9 degrees, which is when we decided to take him to the PD, who inserted a suppository (ouch) which was pretty effective and his temperature returned to normal by early evening.

... Till about 1030pm when he woke up crying and we found his fever had returned with a vengeance. To cut the story of a very long night short, we've been feeding him paracetamol / ibuprofen every alternate 3 hours and also sponging him when he gets too hot, and encouraging him to take fluids orally too.

So anyway, it's almost Saturday noon now snd his fever has been ding donging from 38-39.5 degrees still. My wife talked about bringing him to KK, but from what I heard from parent friends, there won't be much they can do additional to treat his symptoms (I suppose they'll make him take a covid snd dengue test...).

Any advice from parents here who have experienced this before with their kids? I know this is quite common (especially since my kid has started going to childcare since August), but I'd like to hear if anyone has suggestions on how I can make the poor boy feel better.

Many businesses have already thrown in the towel and I have no doubt that many more will go belly up before the crisis is over. Many more may not be facing bankruptcy, but still face cashflow issues due to the lockdown period - you can't complete jobs and earn revenue during this period, but still have to pay salaries and other fixed costs during this period.

In parliament, HSK announced financing packages aimed at extending credit to SMEs to protect local businesses and local jobs during this crisis. This includes generous subsidies on loan programmes to SMEs. If you look at the MAS website, or check out the websites of various banks, you'd think it's pretty accessible - you can apply in as little as 5 minutes.

But in my experience, not all banks are as helpful as they purport to be. One of the Big-3 banks I approached straight up replied to me that they're only offering loans to businesses with annual turnover *half a million* or more. This automatically rules out most startups and small businesses. It's bamboozling because there's *no credit analysis process* \- no 5Cs, no credit scores. They don't care whether you've made a profit, they don't care how long you've been in business, what your business model is, or whether you have ever defaulted on a loan.

If you're not big enough, you're not worth their attention, period. And they don't even tell you this when they advertise for you to apply with them.

Now, I normally wouldn't be so miffed about being denied credit. Banks tend to close their umbrellas during crises. That's typical behaviour. What's disgusting is to know that they're suckling on the sweet teats of generous government subsidies - Ah Gong is bearing 90% of the risk of SME loans obtained during this period. I'm not sure how this subsidy is going to be passed down to SMEs. And they're milking off the insincere PR by advertising all over that they ""*care*"" and profiteering over this crisis.

Now, I haven't yet heard back from the majority of lenders.

hsx5s7,1594997973,hsx5s7,59,,"In light of Racial Harmony day recently, and the various conversations about racism, assimilation, cultural awareness etc, I thought I should pen down my thoughts and experience of the burial ceremony of a Malay Muslim in Singapore. This may also be a part of my grieving process, as I’ve recently lost a loved one during the circuit breaker period (which does makes things slightly different and harder). I would like to add a disclaimer that I’m not an expert on this and would be happy to make any amends to this post if I do get anything wrong - so please feel free to correct me! Happy to also answer any questions and I will try to answer to the best of my ability, otherwise I will have to defer them to other redditors who will somehow be able to answer them! I hope this post will also encourage others to share more about their culture etc since it appears that what we have learned in school is not sufficient.  

Why write on burial process and not something happier like weddings? I think it’s a lot easier to ask your friends of a different religion and culture about weddings as compared to a burial process. I’ve also attended way too many weddings of all races, while I’ve only ever attended 1 Chinese Christian wake - that of a friend’s mum about 10 years ago. Of course when you are there attending the wake / funeral service you won’t be asking many (or any) questions. You can try asking your other friends but chances are, they’re also as clueless as you especially when you were just a teen and your life revolved around revising for A levels.

I will try to keep this as brief as possible so as not to bore you with the nuances and details. When preparing this post, I actually had to research more about certain things and also learned new stuff along the way!

For a start, I should flag something that I think not many people know – there are various sectarian divisions in Islam. The main ones are Sunni Islam (which is what majority of Muslims in Singapore, together with our neighbours like Malaysia, practice) and Shia Islam (practiced in mainly Iran, Iraq etc). There are also various school of thoughts within Sunni Islam itself; Shafi’i (predominantly found in Singapore, Malaysia Brunei etc), Hanafi, Maliki and Hanbali. I will not go into details on this except that we should note that Shafi’i school of thought relies predominantly on the Quran (the holy book) and the Hadiths (a record of words, actions and silent approval of the prophet) for *Sharia* (Islamic laws). This is important because you will see later that certain practices and rituals done are actually not a result of Islamic practices, but are evolved from the Malay culture. 

Let’s start with the most important question first:

**What to do when a Muslim friend / colleague / neighbour recently lost a loved one?**

Personally, I would think it depends on your relationship with the person. If you wish, you can give a monetary contribution to the family of the deceased. There is no fixed amount – so it can be as little as $10 to however much you want to give. Just like most Malay / Muslim weddings, no one will keep a record of how much you give as we believe it is a form of donation and should be sincere. Please do not send condolences flowers – this is not our culture and as we do not hold wakes, it would be awkward if we do receive them. There is also no fixed rule about attire if you were to visit the deceased’s house or even to the cemetery, except of course do dress modestly (i.e. no shorts and sleeveless attire). There is also no fixed rule on colours although please avoid bright colours – black, white, grey etc would be fine.  

As with most cultures, it is fine to send condolences messages. Most people would not know how to react appropriately when someone tells them news of death but I think it’s fine to ask a general question (like how did he pass away) but please do not probe. I remember a classmate losing her brother who was only a few years older than us. Of course we were shocked and wanted to find out the cause of death - was it an unknown illness that he had, or was it because of a road accident? It turns out that he died because of suicide. I was with another friend (Friend A) when she asked the classmate about it. You would think she would stop once she know it was suicide and it was clear that the classmate was uncomfortable to share more. This bimbo went to ask HOW exactly did he die (i.e. overdose? Hang?). We were sitting down at the canteen benches and I stepped on Friend A’s shoes as a hint to stop asking but she went to ask me out loud, in front of the classmate, why I was stepping her shoes… 

**Muslim funeral – Introduction** 

Unlike most culture and religion, a Muslim body needs to buried as soon as possible. It is also *haram* (forbidden) for the body to be embalmed – this is so that the body naturally decomposes into the Earth. I have been told that if the deceased had nail polish on, these will have to be removed. Also, no “foreign items” should be buried with the deceased and this includes dentures. 

Random fun fact #1: In Singapore, burials are usually done in the day so if someone passes away in the evening or at night, the burial will most likely take place the next day. However in our neighbouring countries like Malaysia, they do conduct burials at night. 

A Muslim body will also have to be buried and cremation is *haram*. In Singapore, due to land scarcity, the NEA implemented a policy to limit the burial period for all graves to 15 years, after which the graves will be exhumed and the remains re-buried in smaller individual plots. 

Random fun fact #2: It is not possible to “book” a burial space for yourself in Singapore (i.e. if you wish to be buried beside your spouse’s cemetery etc). This is possible in other countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.  

**Preparing the body**

Usually the deceased will be washed by the relatives of the same gender. This can be done at home or at mosque. For the recent funeral of my late aunt, this was done at Pusara Aman Mosque which is near the Lim Chu Kang Cemetery. I was one of those who helped with the cleaning process and it was my first time. Initially I was quite scared and worried if I did anything wrongly but thankfully there was an *ustazah* (religious teacher) to guide. Because of Covid, we all had to wear our masks throughout and damn was it difficult to be crying with your masks on. It did not help that one of my contact lens came out probably due to all the crying! It was also during fasting month so we could not drink until sunset. It was one of the toughest day for me as I had a headache – not too sure if it was because of the crying, thirst or the uneven eyesight for a few hours.

I used to think that people who helped to clean the deceased will be able to see everything but thank God this is not the case (so I now have 1 less thing to worry when I die lol). There will be a white cloth over the deceased to cover her *aurat* (intimate parts); in Islam the *aurat* between ladies is from the navel to the knees but during the cleaning process, the white cloth was mostly covering my late aunt’s whole body i.e. from her shoulder to her ankle. There was a bar of soap in a container of water and we were given disposable towels (which were like wet tissue but thicker and bigger) to clean her. We cleaned her by lifting the white cloth a little and reaching underneath without technically looking at the body. The cleaning room in the mosque was really good too – she was placed on a mortuary washing table which looks like a normal mortuary trolley but with drainage along the perimeter so as to drain the water away. 

When my late grandparents passed away many years back, this process was conducted at home and specifically in the kitchen. Entry to the kitchen was of course covered and the windows were covered with cloth for privacy. 

Random fun fact #3: I remember when we had my late grandad at home for the cleaning process, all mirrors in the house were covered with cloth - mainly kain batik. I have no idea why this was done and tried to research more. Surprisingly, this is not an Islamic practice as it is not in the Quran nor in any *Hadiths*.

Once the cleaning has been completed, the body will be dried with towels before being wrapped with a few layers of plain white cloth. So for a Muslim body, there are no other garments worn – not a tuxedo or a dress, and not even undergarments. This whole process took more than an hour. Once the deceased is ready, there will be a *solat jenazah* (prayers for the deceased) which is slightly different from the usual daily 5 prayers. This does not take more than a few minutes. 

**The burial process**

The deceased will be buried 6ft underground. Unlike other religions where the body will remain in the coffin, the deceased will be lowered into the grave without any coffin. The white string which was previously holding the cloth at the top of the head of the deceased will be untied and the body will be titled to the right side a little such that the face will be touching earth. There will then be wooden planks to cover the sides and the top, before the grave is covered. 

Random fun fact #4: Just as how Muslims pray facing the Mecca, the bodies are also laid down facing the Mecca.

Random fun fact #5: There was a plot of land in Lim Chu Kang with a few graves which looked similar to a Muslim cemetery but looks odd since they were segregated from the other cemeteries. They turn out to be graves of the followers of Qadiani (Ahmadiyah). I’ve always thought Ahmadiyah was another sect / school of thought of Islam however Muis issued a *fatwa* (a formal ruling) that, I quote, “are not Muslims and are deviant… The bodies of their dead cannot be buried in Muslim burial grounds.”

Random fun fact #6: Previously for all my late grandparents graves, there are 2 *batu nisan* (tombstones) to mark the location of the head and the feet however for my late aunt’s grave, we have been told that there will only be 1 tombstone fixed at the top of all the new graves. I’ve also just found recently that the tombstone for females are flat, while tombstone for males are round. The tombstones in Singapore are usually covered with a white cloth (you can buy cloth and flowers at the entrance of Lim Chu Kang cemetery from the small stalls) however it seems that this is not a practice in our neighbouring countries like Malaysia, which seems to have ruled it to be haram.

Random fun fact #7: The Muslim graves in Singapore can be done up nicely with marbles or granite, and this can be done in any colour. However in Malaysia I believe the colour yellow is strictly for royals only. 

**Superstitions and other practices?** 

As far as I am aware, there are no superstitions as regards to holding a wedding when there has been a recent death in the family. So if you have a wedding planned next month and there was a recent death in the family, going ahead with it will not bring any bad luck. 

However for a woman whose husband has died, the widow may not remarry for 4 lunar months and 10 days after the death of her husband. This is supposedly to ascertain whether a woman is pregnant or not. 

There is no equivalent practice of tomb cleaning day (e.g. Qingming Festival for the Chinese) however usually the days leading up to Ramadhan (holy month in Islamic calendar) and Ramadan would be when most living relatives will visit the cemeteries.",,Funeral ceremony in Singapore - Malay / Muslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hsx5s7/funeral_ceremony_in_singapore_malay_muslim/
i2u9n3,1596448447,i2u9n3,59,,"Hi, my first time posting in this reddit so please delete if this isn't allowed. I did a search, and 4 years ago someone posted about [her mum's hoarding problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3oqafn/daughter_of_a_hoarder/) and it sounds vaguely similar to my situation now. To give some background, my father and brother both passed away one after another within a span of a few years some years back. Since then, it's only left with my mother and I. Suddenly I was forced to become the breadwinner of the family and I was still barely a teen. After graduating from uni, I left to work overseas for a couple of years. But due to this pandemic, I decided to quit my job and now I'm finally back in Singapore. I had only came back to visit my mum once for a short period of time during those couple of years working abroad.   


It has been 3 years since I last visited. Now that I am back, I am in shock of how much junk has piled up in the house. Before my father's and brother's death, she already has the tendency to cling onto stuff (e.g. keeping ""nice-looking"" boxes or bottles). But I think bereavement has triggered her hoarding tendencies to go into full force... She has kept a portion of my brother's belongings (e.g. bike, toys, cpu chassis), tables that my father used to use... and also stuff from my childhood (collections of all sorts like erasers, lettersets, notepads that I no longer want or need)... She also has a tons of clothes and other junk like empty boxes just piling up in the bedroom. She barely cooks and eats poorly, and doesn't do basic cleaning of the house (you can see dust on surfaces, hair on the floor etc)... 

I am desperate to get rid of all these things and other furniture lying around that we no longer need/use (e.g. old piano). I don't mind just throwing them away but that isn't feasible since they are bulky items. I looked online and it costs quite a bit of money to get bulky items disposed of. I also can't do it alone and have no other friends or anyone to help me with the disposal and moving of heavy items. The house also isn't in good shape (e.g. she has to put plastic tape over the electrical switch so you won't get electrocuted when you touch it, the bedroom wall where the air con is supposed to be fitted is falling apart so rain seeps in, the kitchen cabinets are all yellowed and falling apart too..).    


We are in a pretty bad shape financially since she has been unemployed and doesn't seem fit to work as she has underlying health conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure - taking medication for both)... Since I just returned to Singapore, I have not started looking for a job either. Part of why I worked abroad was I couldn't find a suitable job in Singapore. Before I left I had only worked for short periods of time, mostly as a part-timer.  


I guess my question is, are there any organisations or places I can reach to for help with my mum's hoarding problem? Do you know of any junk disposal service for hoarders or any cheap bulk item disposal service? Also, does anyone know who should I contact to repair that leaking wall in the bedroom? :( I feel so overwhelmed right now.

g0koux,1586790397,g0koux,60,,"Living in a flatshare with 2 flatmates who are in relationships. One left at the beginning of the CB to live at the boyfriend's house. The other girl has her BF to sleep over almost every single night. She never has fully asked me if it was OK and truthfully I don't mind all too much from a risk perspective (all young adult expats) but it really is the fact that they seem to have no sense of social responsibility that really grates at me (they were out clubbing etc on the nights prior to CB going into effect). And OK yes, I am a bit concerned for me.

I know the obvious answer is to just be direct but I am concerned she won't handle it well (even prior to this CB he is over A LOT and I think she will flip out when I put my foot down) and I obviously don't want to live with someone moody and resentful at me for the next month for being the ""fun"" police. (I'm just trying to stay healthy and help society flatten the curve!) How have people dealt with these kinds of conversations? Absent being a snitch and reporting them directly, what's the best way of getting the message across? Or do I just snitch? (After I politely tell them of course.)

***EDIT*** When I approached the flatmate today she said she thought it was OK for visitors and made the assumption that if the BF wasn't staying, the BF could visit, to which I said: HELL NO. The surprise turn is that she said, well in that case, she wants to move out. (Ostensibly to find a flat with her BF?) I don't know how that will actually pan out during this period but she prioritized living with and being able to see her BF over general public health and safety. Confirmed covidiot / I am not even certain of how she is going to move out at this point. Luckily I think she just resents the situation and not me, and luckily, I'm in a stable financial position where I am OK to lose a flatmate (and gain unfettered peace of mind for the next few months until I can start searching again.)

As an Singaporean who has lived half his life overseas, I’ve read the news and have witnessed firsthand another nation’s reaction to the virus. Suffice it to say, I have been less then impressed. 

In fact, I personally feel that the country I am currently living in has the exact opposite policy as Singapore’s, as in the government in SG has been playing a proactive role in ensuring the stability of the country, whereas the one that rules the country I’m in has basically been radio silent aside from a few notes here and there. 

Yes, perhaps the PAP made serious mistakes in dealing with the election and the pandemic, and Singapore has served as a cautionary tale to the world, as to not be too overconfident. However, I truly feel that some of the PAP and Cabinet truly wants Singapore to succeed and I’m sure most of you do to.

I know that many of you are frustrated, perhaps because you have lost your jobs, had to take a pay cut, or were suffering under the strain of the circuit breaker, but things will change, perhaps not immediately, but definitely in the near future.

hox3tn,1594414838,hox3tn,61,,"Some thoughts immediately off the top of my head.

1) Turnout was higher this time round despite COVID because everyone is really unhappy with the govt.

2) Opposition need bigger unity if they wants to make a bigger in road. WP has a strong presence in the east now, I expect them to make further inroads with EC and also take on new places like Tampines for example. PSP has strong presence in the West (finally a credible party there) and will probably take down WC next time round the very least and also Marymount. Worth nothing every single seat they contested they had high 30s at the very least. This means PSP is already respected in just their first campaign. 

SDP has made further inroads in central-west areas but they need more quality. They currently only have 2 credible ones in Dr Paul and Dr Chee as evident by their results. If they worked hard in the ground for the next 5 years they will probably win those SMCs over. Overall these are the only relevant opposition parties in Singapore, the rest of the parties (sorry SPP) need to disband or join forces with a stronger one to stay relevant. It is also obvious there's no room for those motley crews to be playful and fight these credible ones or they will lose deposits like at PR GRC. Singaporeans recognise opponent candidates these days more than olden days as it is now a new generation of educated voters who are not swayed by gutter politics or fear tactics. Almost every single opposition seat that has quality has seen close fights. 

3) PAP need to reflect and stop pushing blame like on voter's feelings. It's clear Singaporeans are no longer taken like fools and crap like POFMA and minority Presidency turns off many people. Oh and of course CCS admitting that they took us like fools and gamed the election timings don't help too. The 4g leaders are so bland and devoid of real charisma/quality they seriously need to find more people with diverse backgrounds and not just SAF personnel with no work experience parachuted as MPs. I would really really love to see them play fair politics from now onwards, no gutter ones (like the 3 disgusting press release they gave where personal attacks, terrible analogy and racial assumptions were made). Get rid of GRCs and make it a fair fight. If you work hard and do well on the ground you shouldn't need to game the electoral system to win. Voters do recognise good PAP mps like Sun Xueling, Tin Peiling, Grace Fu etc which continue to have very strong votes. If you put people and Singaporeans first everyone always win. Admit your mistakes and don't hide. When you apologise and vow to improve everyone has time for you.

4) Please have more constructive debates in parliament. Stop giving condescending replies like ""whats the point of your question"" or laugh silly to legit questions just because you can't answer. Very happy to hear LHL says how opposition leader Pritam will have more resources to work with now. This is how healthy politics should be like, for the better of Singapore. 

5) Opposition ward never falls once they take over. They almost always improve their % in normal elections once they take over the ward because of how well managed it is and how hard they work in connecting with all the residents in the estate. Will be interesting to see if this young team in SK can improve their share % next time round for further evidence. 

6) New generation voters is coming up. Everyone is more educated now and think carefully of voting, less of blind voting these days like the older generation who are less educated and more apathetic. It will be a different ball game to fight in the next GE. 

7) Opposition candidates quality are key. Voters have shown that they are likely to have a leap of faith as they deem fit when the opposition has quality candidates. Even West siders votes have swung massively. 

8) Stop gerrymandering? Like I said make it a fair fight. Let Bukit Panjang be there and not at Holland Bukit Timah, let hougang be hougang and not amk grc etc. Draw proper boundaries in accordance to their estate.

9) This time election process was really terribly managed. Please prioritise people's lives and don't call for an election during a pandemic just to win more votes.

2 months ago, I sent them a final warning of doing up an exposé on social media and reporting them to CASE, as I am not the only one who hasn’t gotten the payout. Soon after on the same day, they sent me a canva-crafted message from the founder, explaining how this COVID-19 situation has led them to stretch their financial capacity and difficulty in payouts.

Been coming across plenty of posts exclaiming despair and sorrow at how fucked up the world is, or why xxx did xxx today and why xxx should go to hell and die. 

Yesterday, a young passenger took a ride from me (grab driver) and asked me with a touch of sadness. He asked, given the state things are today, isn't life meaningless and hopeless? Something must be terribly wrong, that our younger brothers and sisters are feeling hopeless despite the comfort and peace we enjoy in Singapore! 

The world isn't fucked up. The world have always been the way it is. In the short history of humanity, we have had countless wars and epidemics. Covid 19 is nothing compared to WW2 or the black death. It's just something that have happened during our short lifetime and that we are too young and too fortunate to have experienced anything truly ""fucked up"". 

Now R/SG community is largely wholesome and kind. That's why we are happy to see wholesome posts on random act of kindness and feel compassion for victims of crime and injustice. 

In order to help make the world ""better"", we must first find our own inner peace. While compassion is beautiful, we can't make meaningful contributions when we are consumed by rage and despair. We have to be the stable lighthouses for the people around us caught in the storm. 

It's easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. What can I, a measly single person, do to make things better? 

ONE single act of kindness and compassion is enough to change EVERYTHING! When you do something to make someone's day a little better, you improve the odds of them behaving in a more positive way to others around them. And the others around them do the same again, you see where its going? Your single action improves the countless lives around you! A simple smile, a moment of active listening with the intent to understand, that's all it takes. Best of all, it's free! Free! 

Similarly when you are overwhelmed with rage and anger, you turn your beautiful compassion into this web of negativity that sticks on to people around you, people that you love.

I think we all trust they are fighting the virus with all they got. My question, however, is why not close schools and encourage companies to work from home? Despite all the containment measures, credible sources such as the CdC and harvard gazette claim that spread can only be delayed , not stopped. Even considering the delayed response of the CCP, the fact remains that  even after a month of whole cities going on lockdown, the situation has not settled down - we are yet to hit the inflextion point.  The health chief came out today saying that SG is in a very precarious position too. Closing schools for one should prevent further transmission ( especially since most students go through public transport) , and not to mention children have weak immunity. Further still, We DEFINITELY do not want them to pass on the disease to the sick and elderly. Most infected areas have closed down schools - even without many cases.  Most sgans work from home atleast once a week ( or so i read in a cna article) ; i would think the amount of meetings and direct contact with clients is going down : infact these therm checks r a waste of precious company time

According to ministry of education, there have been various steps taken by all schools to ensure the safety and well-being of students. It is often argued by the government that school closure will simply result in high rates of secondary to tertiary students mingling around outside of schools due to closure. I’ll attempt to detail the measures my school has taken in an attempt to cope with the clusters in Singapore. Do take note that I am currently in pre-university/Junior College education. 

1. Daily morning temperature checks. It’s religiously conducted every morning and the school has provided everyone with a personal thermometer. However, as we all know, fever as a symptom only occurs after the incubation period. 

2. Daily usage of soap water to wipe our tables. This measure was an initiative by the student body and it seems to be slightly questionable in my opinion. Most people don’t really take this seriously and it instills a false sense of security in the student body + Teachers. 

3. No usage of air-conditioning before 11am. Yea they banned the usage of air-cons before 11am, coz we all know that covid-19 isn’t legally allowed to enter your body after 11am without your permission. 

4. Staggered recess/lunch timing. This is utter BS. Nothing was staggered, it just so happens that my lunch time occurs alongside every single level in the school. Hundreds of students all gathered in canteen together at the same time. Nothing was done to even break these groups up. 

5. Cancellation of competition, school events/ after school events etc. Not taken seriously by the student body either and neither is it being enforced by Teachers. 

6. One seat apart from each other during lectures. Yes, it’s done to space us out. And yes, in a lecture theatre. 

7. Disinfection of mass areas. Such as the library or various lab areas. This one’s pretty well done. 

8. And saving the best for last. Video lectures but with everyone gathered in the lecture theatre to watch it. 

Please understand that I’m not advocating for school closure. I don’t even want school to be closed as they’ll simply pile online learning on us. I’m advocating for more stringent and thorough measures in schools. Most students don’t even take the situation seriously, I have been seeing sick students attend lessons and just joking about the situation as a whole. The measures that have been taken (in my school) is questionable to say the least. But who am I to judge?",,I don’t advocate for school closures in any way.

Admit it. Everytime, new cases of infection emerge, you check quickly to see if they are foreign or local cases. You sigh in relief that most of the infected are foreign workers who had been packed together in dormitories. You might blame their living conditions, packed like sardines. Or rant at the G and their employers. Or even take a swipe at supposedly Third World hygiene standards, and indulge in a little racism.

You take comfort that the number of local cases remain in the 30s or so. Perhaps, being cooped up at home is paying off. You’re almost wishing the foreigners would disappear, since they are one major reason for your lack of mobility.

But, at least, you are not “them’’.

Are you feeling at least a little ashamed at how we couldn’t protect our guest workers properly? That the escalating number of cases reflects how we as a society look upon the foreign workers? We want them here, but we don’t want them near. They shouldn’t be seen nor heard. Now we’re getting all self-righteous about their living conditions - but I bet we still wouldn’t want them in our backyard.

Maybe that’s why except for activist groups, nobody thought much about how they can be breeding grounds for the virus. No authority, not the company which employs them nor those which operate the dormitories. Maybe a few have made some changes, like dispense hand sanitisers or masks or take care to move some workers elsewhere to sleep to give everyone some social distancing space. But look at the numbers and you go “wow’’.

Admit it. Isn’t there a sneaky feeling that Singapore would be “gold’’ again if there weren’t so many of them around? That we wouldn’t have slid in the estimation of the world media or suddenly be turned into a cautionary tale rather than a success story? Do you tell yourself that they have themselves to blame - something you say quietly lest you get accused of being racist?

But tribal feelings are surfacing. You see it in videos captured by vigilantes which refer to foreigners.

Singapore is being humbled by the microscopic virus. We’re not as shiny a red dot as we thought.

We’ve been basking in glory for too long. We’ve become too complacent with our Number 1 accolades and high international rankings in almost all indicators measuring health and wealth. It’s become so that we get cynical or take such No. 1 news as the norm. It’s time to realise they are not the norm but the outcome of exceptionalism.

We congratulated ourselves when the early accolades came, pleased to be living in a country with accessible medical facilities and a Government comprising some of Singapore’s cleverest people. We feel a warm glow all over when we watch our leaders perform on the world’s media. Heck. Barbara Streisand lauds us!

But these days, some commentators have noted that even an efficient and effective country like Singapore can be “caught on the backfoot’’, “drop the ball’’, have “blind spots’’. The complimentary ones say that if Singapore can’t do it, which country can? The less complimentary indulge in some pop psychology about the negative impact of authoritarian regimes.

So now we have stories of the Singapore’s invisible seams shoved into our face. The homeless who require shelter, the poor who are squeezed into their small flats. We are surprised to know there are so many people who go hungry.

We talk about the wonders of technology which connects us with work, family and friends, but realise now that many don’t have such bandwidth (literally) nor the amenities to connect to the outside world.

The people in the lowly jobs know that technology is of no use in their work. They have to hope that their employers getting the G’s wage support will keep them on. Or take on jobs that are now in demand, like delivery drivers. Are they living from hand to mouth, depending on the kindness of strangers or institutions? Should we be thankful that they have $600 now to tide them over? And what about the very rich, including those who took up residence and citizenship here because of what this country can offer them. What are they giving in return? We look at them with green eyes, wondering if it is envy we feel and whether we have any right to demand their participation.

It appears that we have a lot to do in the post-Covid period. We need to think about the social compact we have with the G as well as with each other, and explore the space which civil society has. We need to ask if the media has enough rein to report on the less salubrious aspects of Singapore or to question the judgment of the Government. We need to see what else we’ve ignored as we revel in our great infrastructure and fancy buildings.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herewith are strictly mine as a private citizen and has nothing to do with my employer, the National University of Singapore.**

After Ivangate, we now have the 10-Million-Populationgate. Really not v sexy and not v scandalous, but this kaypoh here has decided that he should weigh in on this topic because having a good handle on our national position on this topic will be critical to this country’s unity in the years ahead. 

In case people have no idea what this 10-Million-Populationgate is about, let’s talk about the manifestos for this GE. Frankly, they are completely underwhelming.

PAP’s manifesto is more or less a summary of the 6 political broadcasts, but cannot blame them. That’s how it works for the incumbent. Nobody is surprised. Nothing to see here. 

Rest of the political parties, uncle here has good news. Next GE don’t need to write manifesto already. Uncle here will write a bot that goes around the coffeeshops to collect all the grievances and deploy an app for you. You go and pick your favourite set of grievances and the app will deploy advanced AI to generate your new manifesto. 

WP’s manifesto is probably the most comprehensive and covered the most ground. Probably includes like 95% of all the complaints. However, there is something uncle here cannot for his life figure out. Wonderboy Dr Jamus Lim claims that they have a plan. A plan to balance their plan. I was once a good, though failed mathematician. I would like to see that spreadsheet and learn some financial magic. In case people don’t realize, “moving left” has a cost and people might want to check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJBzhcSWTk). I might have missed it, but I don't see how WP plans to raise revenue to do their ""left shift.""

I am not out to put down WP and I actually hope that WP can keep both Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC (really!), but I think Pritam needs to learn something from Mr Low and not do such irresponsible electioneering. Just because confirm don’t need to run the Government doesn’t mean WP should anyhow hoot for maximum electoral advantage. 

WP is essentially doing what my weak students do. 2 mark question don’t know the answer, anyhow whack 1 x essay and let the prof pick the answer for him. These kinds of answers, I generally mark zero. I hope that the WP can wake up their idea and do better at next GE. If want to use my auto-manifesto generator also can. I like them (more than the other Opposition parties) so I will give them discount. I need to warn them however that in spite of my genius, I don’t know how to write that magic accounting module. Perhaps after Wonderboy enlightens me, I might be able to add that. No extra charge. 

Two quick notes about the manifestos:

(a) There’s this [Teh Tarik Party manifesto](https://hopeful-ptolemy-1f5c3f.netlify.app/Teh%20Tarik%20Party%20Manifesto%202020.pdf). I think it’s supposed to be a joke, but it’s surprisingly thoughtful and original. Opposition parties might want to take a leaf from this joker(s). 

(b) SDP’s manifesto takes the cake. When I first saw the “No,” I was like what the hell is that? Guess what, the SDP’s strategy was to confront the Government on it’s alleged “plan for 10 million population” and have the Government deny having such a plan. Basically, SDP would be the first Party in the history of Singapore politics to be able to deliver on its election promises even before Polling Day. Genius. Why didn’t I think of that? Maybe next GE can try “Sun will rise from the East”?

&amp;nbsp;

#Background: Population White Paper Circa 2013

That said, there is no smoke without fire. The fact that we are seeing this “10 million population target” suggests that the Government has completely failed to communicate properly. For context, this kaypoh once whacked the Government on the Population White Paper before, back in 2013.^[1] 

To be fair to the Government, the White Paper was patently reasonable. The problem back in 2013 was that the Government was more or less tone-deaf to table that paper while the population was fuming mad over the various issues we were facing. Mostly people were pissed with the over-crowding of the MRTs, and also the breakdowns. 

I cited 4 burning issues back in 2013:

1. The MRT was crowded and broke down every other week
1. The property market was still overpriced
1. The COEs were way too expensive
1. Many Singaporeans were extremely unhappy with the large and sudden influx of foreigners

The first 3 have more or less been fixed thanks to COVID (for better or for worse). In this note, I would be addressing the 4th issue: foreigners in our midst.

Allow me to clarify that everything I am saying today, I already knew back in 2013, but it is seriously unpleasant to try to defend the Government. I was also a bit upset with the Government back in 2013, so I wasn’t in the mood to do so. Basically it wasn’t my job to do so -- which is still the case today.

But, I am speaking up today for 2 reasons:

(a) We are facing this humongous mess called COVID19. PAP has shown itself unable to learn how to communicate clearly after 7 years. I have no reason to believe that anything will change in this GE. Teacher will generally not tell the student the answer, but if the exam is tomorrow and the student is still mucking around and cannot figure out, sometimes will just have to tell the answer. Survive exam first, and then scold later.

(b) We have witnessed both Brexit and the rise of Trump since 2013. The assumption that the population can necessarily tell fact from fiction is severely challenged. I don’t think we want to take any chances. If people want to vote out the PAP, please go ahead, but please make sure that it’s on the basis of fact and not on fiction. The “10 million population target” is just a calculated attempt to make people angry. 

We cannot give in to the politics of anger. 

&amp;nbsp;

#What is the Government’s Target Population?

This question has been making its rounds in view of this 10 million population issue. Chan Chun Seng tried to address this last night in the Mandarin debates, but not sure how many people tuned in, so allow me to clarify a couple of things that should be kinda obvious, except that people don’t seem to understand (perhaps because it’s not tested in the PSLE).

First, notwithstanding that Singaporeans are not reproducing ourselves, the Government does not happily then import foreigners so that we don’t die out. It just \*does not\* work that way.  The claim that Government is importing a lot of foreigners to so that these foreigners will vote for the PAP doesn’t seem to have borne out from what I have seen. In fact, since mid-2010’s, it has become extremely difficult for the foreigners to obtain PR.

Who do I know this? Because in addition to being MP for NUSWhispers, I have also effectively been MP to many of my foreign students in helping them to appeal for PR. People might be wondering why the foreigners would care about PR. One word: school. 

My foreign students have done well and are mostly highly paid software engineers. Living comfortably in Singapore and getting married is not a problem. They love it here. The problem comes when they have kids. Without PR, it becomes nigh impossible to get a place in the local school system and the private schools are way too expensive (they are paid well, but since they are young, they are not quite at expat levels). And when I talk about local schools, we are talking about a random neighbourhood school. Foreigners (PR or otherwise) have very little hope of getting into our branded Primary schools. I have had students go back to their home countries or leave for Canada because of this reason. It is damn stupid for us to import them into this country, train them well and have them leave because they cannot get their kids into school. 

Second, contrary to some claims, Government does not directly create jobs. Mostly what the Government does is to put in money to “incentivize” the private sector to create jobs. Technically, the Government is the biggest consumer of public goods, i.e. sanitation, grass cutting, etc., but most of these functions have been outsourced to the private sector. The Government did magic up thousands of “safe distancing ambassador” and COVID swabber jobs over the last few months, but that’s really a short term immediate relief scheme. I hope that nobody is thinking of a long-term career as a  “safe distancing ambassador.” **Only the private sector is capable of creating good jobs in the long term.** In this light, the Government really has no direct control in terms of how many foreigners will be imported into this country, except to prevent the private sector from hiring foreigners.

Our whole economy is currently being hammered. Many SMEs are folding. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) is only applicable to Singaporeans and PRs. Some 60,000 foreigners have already lost their jobs. Once the scheme ends in August, we will see even more bloodshed. Many Singaporeans, foreigners, all will lose jobs together. Those foreigners who cannot secure a new job and who do not already have PR will all get deported. PAP should just have learnt from SDP and campaigned on reducing foreigner worker numbers by 100,000. Confirm can deliver on election promise. 

One of the advantages of having a lot of foreigners in the local workforce is that in times like this, the foreigners actually provide a significant buffer for the local workers. In the good old days with unemployment at 1% (which I always felt was too low), the Government had very little choice but to allow companies to import foreigners, but as unemployment numbers creep up to 4% or 5%, it will be v difficult for the companies to argue that they cannot find locals willing to work and will die die have to import foreigners. 

I actually have a lot more to say about the issue of foreign workers, but you are probably tired of reading my mad ramblings and my fingers are tired from typing, so I will stop here. 

Allow me to just summarize the issue as follows. The Government does need to work with something in terms of city planning, but that is mostly an infrastructure problem. That’s where we have these 6.9m and 10m numbers. Basic idea is to make sure that things are spread out enough that we do not get congestion no matter how much the population grows. The problem with infrastructure is that it takes a long time and long-term planning to do properly, so we need to be kiasu a bit and plan for it to be so big that we can be assured we won’t run into the wall. 

The actual population growth depends on how the economy grows. General principle is to allow adequate supply of foreign labour to maintain steady growth while keeping local unemployment low. More or less like that.  Government does not have a full view of how things will turn out. If the PAP Government wants to claim that it is omniscient, then I stand corrected and rest my case. Given COVID, past trends are of absolutely no help. Also, technological disruptions are another headache. If autonomous cars appear, then all the taxi uncles and Grab drivers will be out of jobs overnight and the Government will have yet another 60,000 unemployed people to deal with. When it comes to dealing with the economy, who the hell knows exactly what will happen? 2 decades ago, we didn’t even have iPhones!

&amp;nbsp;

#The Real Threat to Singapore Livelihoods: WFH, Not Foreigners

To conclude, I think that everyone is barking up the wrong tree. 

Post-COVID, everything is going to change. Why? Because WFH actually works and in many cases, works v v well. [80% of Singaporeans surveyed want to work from home](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/8-10-spore-employees-wish-continue-working-home-after-circuit-breaker-survey). Some of these are good workers. The rest are likely slackers. The remaining 20%? The bosses. :-P

More seriously, it is v difficult (if not impossible) to change work habits, but COVID19 has forced many companies to work differently and because Zoom works really well, many are going to find that working remotely will help them save on office rental. 

WFH allows the productive workers to save time from commuting and also provides them with significantly more flexibility to manage their time (as long as MOE doesn’t also close and they can continue to pack their kids off to school). 

The flip side is that there are slackers among us (you know the ones who will chao keng during NS?). There are also the older workers who are unable to cope with technology. Also, a lot of the jobs in our current economy are really bullsh*t jobs. What are these jobs? These jobs don’t actually need a degree or specialized skills. Mostly it is people shuffling paper and sending emails, and having long, meaningless meetings. Sounds familiar? 

WFH requires more communication skills than degrees. Notwithstanding our so-called world class education system and high PISA scores, I daresay that the Americans are much better communicators than Singaporeans at large. 

Given the abysmal state of the American economy and our high cost structure, I would not be surprised if our local companies start outsourcing to the US. Timezone is a problem? Perhaps, but there are people like me who are fully functional in the middle of the night and who prefer to sleep in the day. If people are hungry enough, they will be willing to take on jobs at odd hours, especially if they have no need to leave their homes.

Tuition in Singapore will also be moving online. Since Phase 2, my daughter is now doing alternate week Zoom for Chinese tuition. My wife is also v tired of having to ferry her to tuition every week. 100% Zoom is frankly ok for us, but the Chinese teacher suggested this blended arrangement, and so we just played along. 

Most things in life, cut both ways. While WFH puts us at risk of losing jobs overseas, it also provides our people with access to better jobs globally. A small number of my students have over the years been able to work from the beaches in Australia or at the cafes in Paris. This lifestyle is just going to be much more common moving forward for the mobile knowledge workers. 

The question that needs to be asked is not so much what is that target number of foreigners, but how are we going to respond to these seismic shifts in the global economy?

&amp;nbsp;

\-------

**Addendum**

I don’t know exactly what the Government at large is doing, but I did receive an email from DPM Heng a couple of months ago. DPM was my ex-boss at MOE. He asked, “We need to invest in online learning, do you have any ideas on how we might be able do it?” Since then, his dunno what Emerge Stronger Taskforce has also gotten in touch to discuss the export of our education services/offerings as a new potential engine of growth for this country. Will the Government succeed in leading this country out of the current mess? I suspect that it’s too early to say, but sure as hell, people are working on it. 

And yes, this is the DPM who works too hard and who doesn’t sleep enough. Yes, so he makes a bungle on Nomination Day because he doesn’t get enough rest. 

And people make fun of him. 

I hope that all of you are proud of yourselves.

General Singaporeans are resuming their normal daily life. Hardly see anyone wearing masks now. Social distancing is non-existant here. Schools still open. Malls still packed. It's as if Singaporeans forget that there are more active cases of infections compared to when DORSCON Orange was announced. We rely to much on our government to handle the situation.

Just before the SHN from ASEAN countries was imposed, I was in Indonesia for several days. I see them practicing social distancing; staffs reminding passengers to not seat near each other and leave a seat in between unoccupied. Lifts have markings on them where people should stand  etc. Many more of them wearing masks. It's honestly eye-opening to me.

As you all know about the covid-19 virus, many of you think that it's all being exaggerated. That quarantine is useless. That it won't affect you. You're all complaining about not being able to see your friends, family, significant other. But if you ignore the government's advice to stay home, what happens if you got infected? And you infecting others? Even if you are healthy and wouldn't die from the virus, an elderly might be, a baby might be, and that'll be your fault. The taxi driver you sit in an enclosed space with, the commuters you come in contact with on public transports, the people working in an enclosed space with you, they're gonna be suffering too.


Have you ever thought about you overloading the hospitals? That people who needs it more can't be treated because of you being selfish? Have you read up on the situation in other countries? There are countries with insufficient test kits and people are infecting more people without even realising it. There's an incubation period of 2 weeks where there's no symptoms shown and you could very well be spreading it. There isn't a cure for it right now, the doctors won't be able to save those who are in critical condition. They are going to see a patient slowly deteriorate knowing they can't do anything about it. 


Those who work have no choice but those who don't, please stay home. People are worried about the economy falling but if the situation continues to worsen, shops would have to be closed, companies would be forced to layoff employees, people would lose their jobs, people would no longer have income to support their families, mass recessions.

g2gvgk,1587050366,g2gvgk,64,,"Hi everyone, hope y'all are safe and healthy! This is my first time posting in reddit. I genuinely need and am curious about your opinion on my situation. I would like to hear unbiased opinions other than my friend's, which hopefully will be helpful for my own consideration :)

So a bit of background. I am a foreigner (S Pass holder), been here for almost 5 years (3 years as a student and 1.5 years working). I'm currently working in arts and design industry. As the title said... I have been considering about resigning from my job.  

I know, it sounds crazy. People are getting laid off here and there and here's me, wanting to resign despite being very privileged to be able to keep my job. This is because of the toxic environment (micromanagement, lots of blame game, messed up management system, and toxic higher-ups and boss). These reasons are also why the turnover rate is very, very high in my company. I have been wanting to quit since the first month I joined, but I am currently tied to a 3-year contract with the government for studies grant, so I kept telling myself to hold out for a year at least.

On one side, I am very grateful to still be able to work, but on the other hand I am not coping with it well mentally. Especially these past few months, the burnout has been getting way worse, and the fact that I have to deal with lots of unnecessary shit with my boss due to his paranoid nature isnt helping at all. I know no job comes easy, the work itself, despite being challenging, I do not mind. But I have held out long enough in my opinion, and I am very sick of having to deal with such toxic people. I have reached my limit.

But with the current situation, I am fully aware that this is not the best time, and it makes me feel guilty. If I end up resigning, I will have to leave Singapore and go back to my home country, which I personally do not mind as I have been homesick for a long time. I also have enough savings to get by, luckily. It's just that now my dad's business is not going well either due to covid, and it just makes me feel even more guilty if I go home jobless. :(
I really have to choose between financial and mental health.

What would you do if you were in my shoes? (anw thanks for taking your time reading this longass text!)

hiokcf,1593527926,hiokcf,66,,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&amp;#x200B;

Hougang SMC &amp; Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

hlxuji,1593996520,hlxuji,66,,"So I am trying to find the original statement from Dr Tambyah which I could only find here ([https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-focus-on-public-health-could-have-been-lost-paul-tambyah-12899558](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-focus-on-public-health-could-have-been-lost-paul-tambyah-12899558)

 ""And then what happened was the employers started thinking, 'hey my  workers are living in the same dormitory maybe you should bring them for  testing'. 

""And then what happened was Ministry of Manpower  issued a statement telling the employers they were not allowed to bring  their workers for testing, and if they brought their workers for  testing, they would lose their work pass privileges,"" 

So MOM say got three falsehoods,

1. MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they  brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they would lose  their work pass privileges.
2. MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers.
3. MOM made these decisions without consulting public health medical professionals or MOH.

They explained ([https://www.gov.sg/article/factually050720a](https://www.gov.sg/article/factually050720a)),

* In its advisory to employers, MOM did not say that employers  could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively  discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: “Do not send  workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is  unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek  medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the  worker needs to be sent to the hospital.”     
 
* The MOM advisory also did not state that employers who  brought their workers for testing would lose their work pass privileges.  What MOM said was: “Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that  medical emergencies are handled promptly. We encourage you to be  socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a  medical emergency as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to  those who need it. Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical  facility may have their work pass privileges suspended.”

So what I read from this is, MOM did discourage employers to send workers to the hospital unless it's an medical emergency. (clinics cannot do testing). Irresponsible employers (those who anyhow send workers) may have their work pass privileges suspended. They did send emails to employers on this (actively discourage). I just cannot find the source for the third statement if Dr Tambyah really said that.

So I ask you, false statement or not. Since POFMA don't need court to judge, I will ask you for your take on this. From what I have managed to gather, **I don't think it's justified.** I am prepared to be proven wrong but feel free to put your case forward, but please use reliable sources to back your claims.",,This POFMA against Dr Paul Tambyah...

in fact, i feel glad that i am non-essential because the responsibility of being the one people turn to when shit hits the fan is so unimaginably heavy and i sincerely respect everyone who carries this burden as their job. 

what i disagree with is artists being the TOP non-essential job. right now, many jobs are deemed non-essential whether you're an investment specialist, corporate lawyer or a teacher. so who's to say that one job is more non-essential than the other. especially in singapore's context where the arts are already looked down upon by the general public, it was totally unnecessary to put down artists even more. that said, it was heartening to see the outpouring of support for artists even in the ST comments section and hope this support will continue tangibly in the form of patronage for the arts.

i7kaci,1597116681,i7kaci,67,,"warning: long post of reflections. :)

My dad has always come cross to me as a strict, no- nonsense guy who works really hard and can be harsh and sometimes appears as non-negotiable and a little authoritarian. 

it wasnt until recent months in the light of this pandemic and societal needs that caused my eyes to open more and to reflect on how I have benefitted from all he had done, and how in many ways, my many siblings and I have also taken him for granted and even considered kicking him out of the home.

a bit of background, my father married my mother many years ago, when things weren't doing so well for her. he came forward and promised to protect her in the midst of difficult times in her family and situations. there were fights, distress and he came into her life, promising to provide her that stability and growth and to build the family with her. he faced much opposition but he was determined. 

he worked hard to win over the family and slowly but surely, established himself as the head of the household. he worked hard, long hours and had to take on multiple roles to ensure that the family had food on the table. that included working with people outside the family, networking with neighbours and keeping good relations so that in times of need, he knew the family would have the support and help we could get. of course this took humility and putting his pride aside, but it proved true and helpful as our family had to depend on the help of our neighbours many times through the years. we never could understand why my father insisted on helping and giving to others despite our tight budgets, but looking back, i saw the wisdom in how it came back to help us in times of need. 

my father established strict rules and expectations on us. he made us do duties at home, compulsory habits like locking the doors and taking the security of our home well, never taking the security of our home for granted. he would punish us strictly when we crossed the lines and despite many people's comments and neighbours concerns, my father held to his beliefs and his values firmly. looking back on these, I start to realize that this had contributed to us, his children, being seen as trustworthy and individuals who are well brought up and welcome in many homes and families. even my friends parents trusted us as they knew we came from a home where values were ingrained in us. we never liked the process, but are starting to see the benefits of it. 

my father emphasized on education and hard work. he always ensured that we had access and resources to education. all my siblings and I were always given what we need to learn well and were often recognized for our hard work and achievements. this meant moving the family budget for many enjoyable things to studies and tuition and the likes. of course, no children enjoyed these but over the years, it had gotten us the needed skills and knowledge to get a good job and career. despite the ups and downs, I know with my education that I received, I can stand a higher chance to succeed as long as I am willing to persevere.

my father also forced us to save a sizeable part of our pocket money, part time job earnings or ang pow money. we had to lock that part in regardless and could only use it for key purchases. he always told us that someday we will need these money for ourselves and future families. we never could understand that and always felt like a part of our ability to spend with friends and in the things we liked was taken away and locked behind our accounts. even the family's money was treated in this way and we never really felt that we got to enjoy the financial comforts and surplus that our family had over the years. we could only spend a part of what we had. true enough though, when it came to the time for us to make big purchases for ourselves like further studies or things we truly needed like a new home or even an updated security device for our home, we had the sum of money ready to be used. 

over the years, my father had also changed in his ways. as we became more independent and the family slowly grew in financial stability and comfort, he made more time and spent more resources in activities that helped the family bond more together. spent more time listening and while he may have kept to his values and ways to a large extent, I could see him bend over in certain areas and begin to take in our views and insights. of course when we were young, we always felt we never had a voice. dad was always the decision maker and it sometimes felt like we didnt have any say. He has nonetheless made more time for us, and even though we had many siblings, he did us best to individualise his time with us and to meet our needs. 

but I guess theres a time for everything. during the early years when things were really tough and turbulent for the family, there was less leeway for many voices but the family really needed a captain to steer through the storms in the best way possible. my father was that captain and we are where we are today thanks to his wisdom and tenacity as the head of our home. 

it wasn't until recently that it seemed like another guy wanted in on our family. he was younger than my dad, more savvy, more trendy and charismatic. he bought us char kway teow with cockles and seemed to know what we really liked! he came across as one who really stood by his own values as well, yet added a vibrancy to the home. it was nice to have him around. he often talked about my father being thrifty and keeping the family finances for himself or behind locked accounts in a secretive manner, questioning whether we should have access to our angpow money and and when we like it to. it made us doubt our father's integrity. 

my father seemed to have always known him to be around, and would often question his intentions and methods. of course my father isn't perfect and at times, it seemed that he was jealous of his new guy and came across as controlling and maybe even insecure of losing his place as head of the family. I mean, some of my siblings did express their preference for this new guy and the ""balance"" he could bring into the family. 

as I look back, I begin to realise that sometimes I am so caught up in the moment, in my needs and wants that I fail to not only appreciate the many years of work and sacrifice that my father had given to us and the family, I even began to lose sight of the values and beliefs that he had built into us, and hoped that we can pass on to our future generations. I admit that our generation likes things fast, things that sound and feels good and does not like to take the path of pain, discipline and hard work that my father and mother had to. but truth be told, we are able to have this choice today because or what they had done for us, laying the foundation for a better future for our tomorrow. 

I reflected and realized that if I want to lay an even stronger foundation for our own families and future generations, the values of hard work, love for the family and prudence has to be passed on through us. wanting to live freely and to forgo all these values would only cause all the years of hard work and stability that had been built up, to be torn apart and potentially unstable all over again. to spend freely that money that had been painstakingly saved for a rainy day would mean we have less when we really need it. 

for the family to grow stronger, we need to build on what was previously laid for us, and though times are better, to never forget the wisdom and prudence that our father had taught us and continues to be relevant for the years ahead. the world isn't getting better and in many ways, our children will be facing a more challenging and complex world. my father taught us to sacrifice and to always do what is right, even if it meant having to take the hits and curses from family or loved ones, or even neighbours or outsiders. to be unwavering in this sea of waves. my father stuck to what he knew was best for our family.

I'm thankful for my father and while he isn't perfect, he has brought us to where we are today. his wisdom and voice is still the voice of reason and all the years, relationships and experience he has gathered, makes me confident that he will continue to keep this family strong and happy, protected and safe, successful and loved for the many many years aged. 

thank you dad.

For the past years of my life after dropping out, I have been working in the customer service line. There are many nice people I have met, and there’s also a fair share of nasty and rude people. 

I recently just started a new job, I have been doing my own things and doing what I need to do.  at work. I have never ever lost my temper towards rude customers and I just ignore them, but a few days ago, I lashed out at several of them. I am a very “Do no harm; take no shit” kind of person. I am so sick and tired of people being impatient and rude.

There are aunties saying that we are not taking our jobs seriously just because we didn’t make her drinks first. Her number was way behind other customers so obviously the “first come, first serve” applies here. And then another aunty said our new shop was shit just because we didn’t have a certain flavour in stock. Too bad that you didn’t come early and blame us for selling out. 

I always try my best to be as professional as possible when it comes to things like these. But it doesn’t mean I am going to sit down and keep quiet when you cross the line. There is a clear line between constructive criticism and just plainly insulting me or my co-workers. Being an asshole to me or my colleagues is not going to make anything better for me and for you.

I am tired, you are tired, we are ALL tired. We are all trying our best to serve you and provide you with the best of our potential, especially while this whole pandemic is happening. Trust me, everyone is really putting in effort. There is no damn use trying to degrade us. Just because you degrade me, it doesn’t mean I am going to serve you any faster. 

When it is peak hours, obviously the service will be a little slower considering that where I work at just recently opened. We tend to be crowded during lunch hours and we want you to understand that. 

“The customer is always right.” applies to every customer service job. I think it is bullshit but it is what we are working for. 

If you think you are so entitled, kindly go to another shop and let them kiss you on the ass there. Because I am not doing it. Try working like us and see if you like it when you are being treated unfairly. 

I am trying to make a living peacefully, I am trying my best to provide income for myself. Please. Please be a little nicer.

It literally cost no money to be nice to people. Everyone is tired and you don’t know what people are going through, it really wouldn’t hurt to be kind.

I have an extremely toxic parent. She’s a narcissist and I suspect, a little bipolar as well. In her crazy frenzy, she would blast music when I’m asleep and then insist I wasn’t asleep. After the initial argument, she would immediately slander me for only hanging out with rich people (which is entirely not true), that I don’t have real friends and all my friends are only temporary (which is also not true, I spent most of 2019 kicking out toxic friends, and keeping my close friends even closer). I never really lived my life, I could only go overseas when I don’t inform her bcos she would always say no, and when I’m overseas, she would call my friends instead of me, to ask about us. Once we quarreled and she said she always wanted to jump down. She also has special snowflake syndrome, just not the Karen level yet. When I WFH, she would type extremely loud on her keyboard even when i voice out that it’s my pet peeve several times, and asked me to deal with it. She also would not eat the dinners that my siblings and i cook. She always says things like “sorry you guys only eat atas food” and proceeds to cook plain porridge for herself. Note that we are not poor, and average. After all these paggro remarks, she proceeds to give us $30 each a day.

It’s been 3 weeks and we still can’t find any legitimate sources.

It’s not a 100% protection, but at least we feel safer when he wears them when he’s out.

I am fairly familiar with Singapore, since I've been coming here fairly often when I was little for a family member's cancer treatment. So when it was decided that I was going to uni in SG, I was not surprised. It was close to home, safe, and in some aspects affordable in terms of living costs. My friends studying in the US, UK, or Australia all freak out when I tell them my favorite meal is 3.5 sgd pork rice from just behind my apartment building, when the minimum amount for them to eat out would be around 10-20$. 

I've stayed in SG for about 3.5 years now, and made friends with a lot of locals. They love showing me all the local spots, and I've gotta say, locals my age group LOVE to drink. They fucking love it. I had a good time with all of them, before most of them went off to do NS and I had to make friends with the older guys in class. They are also fun, and they try their best to get me to go to the gym lol.

But both local and international student friends of mine, some not all, tend to have a common complaint. They think Singapore is boring. The buildings all look the same, the food while delicious is the same in most hawker spots, and there's not much here in terms of recreational activities. I don't exactly agree with this, but honestly sometimes I do get bored here. I tried hiking and honing my photography skills here, but that got old fast. But the one thing I never get tired of, is solo taxi rides when I need to go somewhere or just go home. I love striking a conversation with the drivers. Be it young guys in online cabs, or uncles in the trans cabs. They come from all walks of life and all have interesting stories. It's amazing that they are mostly willing to share deep, personal stories about their backgrounds and experiences. I guess they sort of see me as blogging to a reddit throwaway account, where they don't have to worry about their loved ones finding out about all their deepest darkest secrets. 

I could be taking a trip from balestier and the kind driver would tell me stories about how Jalan Dusun was once a movie theater and how he used to go there all the time in his youth. I once had a driver with a large spiderman toy attached to his van explain to me that his son loves spiderman and so he puts the toy there to remind him of his son during work. I hailed a cab in Marina Bay Sands and the uncle explained that I was wasting money playing there and should go to Malaysia if I was really serious about my gambling lol. Then he offered to sell me tickets to a seminar from a guru to boost my gambling fortunes. I booked an online cab from the peace mansion building and the driver actually saved me from a nearby drunk guy trying to fight me because I couldn't speak Chinese. We later laughed about it and he explained to me that he used to be an alcoholic in his youth, until he decided to change one day. He then gave me tips on how to stop drinking and just talked about life. It's like an endless storybook, and the one aspect of my adventure in Singapore that never gets boring; its people.

But now, I can't go back due to the virus and I have to do the last semester of my uni life online. Not the goodbye that I imagined, so its kinda sad.

I work in Tech especially IOT etc so quite convinced that those are easily possible.
Without going into the merits of whether it’s right or wrong, let’s understand what this data about all Singaporeans could potentially do:
1. Create a clear network of every individual including people they have met or been around in close proximity of. Repeat encounters would mean that there is some relation between the two - could be a shopkeeper-customer, friend, relative or any other relation but establishes they know each other.
2. Understand people’s commute and consumption preferences at a granular level.
etc etc
This data is powerful and could be used for a number of use cases including increasing consumption through targeted messaging, creating accurate town planning maps, allocate appropriate business licenses etc .

I believe that there definitely is a chance that this data could be used for other not so noble purposes, bit we can give the benefit of doubt.

After the first incident, my mom and dad got into a huge fight over the fact and all of my siblings, including myself, are extremely angry at him. When the announcement was made that masks were compulsory, he was the first to flaunt the rules to us and warn us about the fines.

We figured, okay, maybe he got it through his thick skull that you shouldn't do that. Well I guess fucking not. Both times, the people who came over were his friends and they ended up just having small talk so it wasn't even anything remotely important to excuse breaking the rule.

She's more or less ignoring the problem now as ""no matter how many times I confront him about something, he won't listen.""

g5i0m1,1587485238,g5i0m1,70,,"In the past month, so many friends tested positive, not for covid19, but for pregnancy. I gathered some common misconceptions causing infertility and clarify them here.

Number 1: Use fresh sperm.
Survey said singaporeans only have sex once a week, but like that is shooting out empty bullets only. The sperm all die oredi, cannot swim, might even leak out. Successful goal requires Fresh sperm, like 3 days old still okay. If sex every 3 days is too tiring, then use hand 3 days before the golden date to clear off the dead sperm la.

Number 2: Golden date is around 3 days before ovulation day.
Guardian/watson is still open, Qoo10 also can buy ovulation test kit. Actually Qoo10 cheap ones might be better if wife want to test every single day. Roughly 3 days Before the peak ovulation date, must attack the goalkeeper already. Also roughly 1-2 days before the peak ovulation day, the test kit will already show that wife is fertile. Don't want to use test kit also can, use calendar to count ovulation date if wife period is regular. If not, take temperature every day, if her temperature goes up slightly, you know she is feeling it. 😉

Number 3: Pregnancy Diet Keeps Baby Heartbeat Going.
Please start wife on a pregnancy diet once you start attacking the goal post. Don't wait till pregnancy test kit show positive (4-6 weeks later) or doc appt (2mths++ later) to change diet. Why is pregnancy diet so important? Heard of those whose baby has no heartbeat? It could be due to toxoplasmosis which comes from undercooked meat and cat litter, so avoid that too. Everything just cook thoroughly and properly. No deli meat like ham &amp; sausage. No raw/undercooked soft cheese so bake your own pizza at home to ensure cheese is fully cooked. No papaya, grape, pineapple. Avoid herbs unless u r an expert in herbs because a lot of complications e.g. uterus contraction etc. Pregnancy tonic is okay. Bak kut teh also a no no because don't know what herbs go put inside. No alcohol, not even DOM and shaoxing cooking wine, it will penetrate the placenta filter and reach the baby, affecting baby growth. No smoking. Limit caffeine. Eat 400mcg-800mcg of folic acid daily to prevent neural tube defects, buy from guardian/watson.

Number 4: Schedule Doc Appt in Week 8.
If positive test, schedule doc appt to happen between week 8-10. Don't bother going earlier because cannot detect baby heartbeat yet, and end up scaring yourself only.

If govt wants to give a bigger baby bonus for those who got positive result during circuit breaker, how nice would that be? Err positive pregnancy result, not covid19, obviously.

From my own experience, SEPHORA SG has been beyond terrible at this moment.

The venue was sanitized and there is a temperature screening station, it took about a 10 minutes wait for me to be registered and another 10 minute to go through a blood prick test to check my haemoglobin and a doctor screening to review my declarations. 

Waiting for a bed might take longer but I was ushered in immediately as there was an open bed, and the nurses was thorough in ensuring it was a smooth experience. 

I have a phobia of needles but it helped that the nurse attending to me exercised care and was communicative, just bring your phone and earpieces and close your eyes during the procedure of them setting up your intravenous line if you tend to get afraid too. :)

15 or so minutes later, and the machine started beeping to signal I was finished, and another nurse helped remove the line and needle. A short wait later and she bandaged me up and provided a small booklet on when I could donate next and a supplement tablet of iron. 

There's refreshment area for doners before you leave and I helped myself to oreo and apple juice after washing my hands and there was cookies and raisins available too!

I responded to calls at a workers dormitory. There were frequent thefts happening between the residents. I remember walking into their quarters: a room, approximate 300 square feet in size, with bunkbeds lining the room from wall to wall. I counted about 12 beds.

None of the beds had mattresses. A thin piece of plywood covered the grilled base frame. The room was illuminated by a single light bulb dangling from the ceiling. The wires were exposed.

Walking into the bathroom, I was greeted with a foul stench. Never had I smelled a toilet like this anywhere else in Singapore. The rubbish bin, or rather, the rubbish area was heaped with rubbish up to my shoulder. Flies, rats and cockroaches found paradise in these toilets and forms in general.

For the past couple of weeks I've been going down to several different dormitories to take samples from these foreign workers. Ten years has lapsed since I was a policeman. 

I am ashamed to say that conditions have not improved. This has undoubtedly contributed to the rapid spread of the virus in these communities.

The silver lining to this catastrophe is that a light has now been cast upon the dismal third world conditions that these people are forced to endure in our ""first world"" country.

I feel especially ashamed of my colleagues who are now posting photos of themselves on social media carrying out these tests.

gp0k67,1590217415,gp0k67,74,,"I've been reading articles regarding Robertson Quay and I have to say that the authorities' response to them has been downright unsatisfactory. 

For example, take a look at how the police said they would investigate those who flouted CB rules near Robertson Quay. Before people made a big hoo-hah about it, what did they do? Nothing. We shouldn't HAVE to make noise for them to take action. Even before that, there have been considerably fewer policemen and ""ambassadors"" patrolling the more atas areas in Singapore where expats tend to live as compared to the heartlands. Why is that? Don't tell me it's because fewer people live there. We have already seen concrete proof that lower population does not equate to higher compliance to the CB (case in point, Robertson Quay). 

The incident regarding a certain Mr Zhao has only further confirmed what I already knew to be a fact- that the authorities are giving preferential treatment to those living in  affluent areas while those in the heartlands are made to strictly follow through with CB regulations. For those who don't know, a Singaporean named Mr Zhao apparently decided to take things into his own hands by advising several foreigners (or ""expats"" if you want to be PC about it) along Robertson Quay to put on their mask properly. Instead of politely complying, a few of them rudely dismissed him and started spewing vulgarities at him. 

I can see some of you jumping off your butts now protesting that ""Not all expats are like that"". And you'd be right. It's wrong to generalise an entire community. It's also besides the point. The expat community has little to no control over how the authorities, and by extension society, view them. This is about the *response* to a few within a community, *not* about said community as a whole. 

Disgusting response by the expats above aside, the question is why did Mr Zhao have to take things into his own hands in the first place? Don't we have ""ambassadors"" and the police for that? Where were they when they were needed? Whether the enforcers of CB are turning a blind eye to expats due to orders from above, or due to their own accord, it has become painfully clear that these ""expats"" are getting off easy. Again, why? Are the enforcers scared of them? Do they feel the need to suck up to them due to some sort of inferiority complex? I honestly hope this isn't the case, and I'm begging someone to convince me otherwise. 

The authorities really need to think what kind of message they are sending the people when the law is not equally enforced throughout. Why isn't everyone held accountable to the same standard? Whether they think more highly of ""expats"", or if it's simply because they don't trust the locals enough to follow the law, it's sadly apparent that they aren't even trying to hide the bias. If you're going to treat one group better than the other, the least you could do is act like you care and pretend to treat everyone equally, and that is a low, LOW bar to clear. 

I have no doubt that this post is going to receive alot of backlash from the PC gang and maybe even a few expats trying to plead their case. It doesn't matter, I needed to get this off my chest and I've done my best to write the above as rationally and coherently as I humanly can.

Now we have almost as many deaths from dengue as COVID. Why aren't we freaking out about dengue? Why aren't we locked down? Forced by the government to wear full skin covering to prevent infection? Dengue is in fact more deadly than COVID here (same number of deaths, far fewer cases).

The COVID case fatality rate in SG is 0.04%. Let's say everyone in Singapore became a case, we would expect about 1600 people to die.

Our resilience fund took $50bn from the SWF. 

So we saved about 1570 lives. Each one of those lives cost us about $30m just in the reliance fund. Add in all the other costs, business that have gone broke, the drop in tax revenue for years to come, let alone all the unmeasurable emotional and social costs, and that toll is far higher. Ok, every life is sacred. I understand. But then why don't we have a dengue resilience fund to save lives? What about the 420 people who die each year from preventable urinary tract infections? Where is their funding if this is about saving lives?

This doesn't make any sense and the excuses for basically destroying or economy and social environment don't stack up of we apply the reasoning to any other situation.

This is one week's data extracted from my phone's TraceTogether app - which as most of you know by now, uses BLE to send data (`encrypted_tempID, time, phone_model, signal_strength`) to other phones nearby to record `pings`, which can form a `contact session`. The data, which does not contain any location or personally identifiable information, is then stored on the device and can be submitted for future contact tracing should the need arise.  


**1.** **Explanation of the terms used:**

&gt;`Pings` indicate the total number of times my phone's BLE connected to a nearby phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;`Sessions` indicate the number of unique encrypted temporary IDs my phone received from all the pings (Note: these IDs refresh after a set amount of time, so the same device may have multiple tempIDs resulting in multiple sessions recorded.)  
&gt;  
&gt;`Phone Models` are the total unique phone models (eg. Samsung Galaxy S9 or iPhone XS) aggregated from all the sessions.  
&gt;  
&gt;`Signal Strength` is inverse of the bluetooth signal loss for each ping which ranges from -100 to 0 where 0 means no loss (very strong) and -100 means near 100% loss (very weak). I could not come up with any meaningful use for representing this visually, but the average signal strength is 18.4% (or -81.5 sig loss) if anybody was curious.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-----  
&gt;  
&gt;**Theres no way to accurately know how many people I came into 'contact' with** due to the temporary ID refreshing regularly - but it is definitely some number between the total number of `Sessions` and total `Phone Models`.

  
**2.** **Why did I do this?**  
I mainly wanted to know whether the app was even working for me! Without any numbers shown on the app, its basically saying ""trust me, I'm running in the background"" which I understand for privacy reasons might be ideal, but it doesn't give users sufficient feedback about their usage.   


I was also slightly worried because immediately after signing up, I disabled all data usage for the app, because based on my understanding of how it works, data is technically not needed at all except for analytics (snowplow, firebase analytics, twitter advertising?), but without any information on the app, I couldn't be a 100% sure without extracting my own data. 

  
**3. How much have I been out of the house?**  
This data was for the first week that I was using the app (21st Mar - 28th Mar) and during that time I did out go out a few times for food and errands - mostly walking or cycling distance away. Except for one of those trips, where I took public transport; which explains the huge purple spike in the graph for one particular day. (I'm not using the most recent data because I haven't left my house in the last 4 days now so the graph would just be flat lines everywhere).  


My company has had mandatory WFH since mid march, so I haven't needed to travel much at all for more than 3 weeks now. But I'm surprised how many contact sessions i've incurred just by going to my neighborhood hawker center to tapao food.  


**4. Some Interesting observations:**

* I had almost no iPhone contact sessions; they may have accounted for 5.9% of my sessions but each one had just 1 single ping, resulting in just 0.6% of all pings. This shouldn't be surprising considering iPhone users have to keep the app open all the time; I'm impressed that there were diligent iPhone users who put in the effort.
* The vast majority of contact sessions had less than 10 pings (I observed most pings sharing the same session to occur continually every 1-4s until they are out of range.) which I guess I can consider 'transient contact'?
* Samsung is the most popular brand among the stranger I came into contact with, by a huge margin.  


AFAIK **You do NOT need mobile data to use this app** and you don't need to wait for any special update; If you are using the newer versions of Android, you can disable internet connection for any app you want:

[A whooping 0 bytes of internet used \(reset after signing up\)](https://preview.redd.it/10pp5v11hfq41.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4010856946eb5d60b410168ee910036b3a6cdb41)

  
Long press on the app to go to 'App Info' (or access this through application settings) &gt; 'Mobile data &amp; Wi-Fi'. Then disable Background data, Foreground Wi-Fi and Foreground Mobile data usage.  


======

tl;dr: The app works and does not store PII or location data and only stores encrypted temporary IDs which keep changing even for the same device. There is a quite a number of people using the app; I was amazed at the number of 'contact sessions' my phone made in a week even though I didn't go out much at all.

gn7zc0,1589965478,gn7zc0,76,,"I saw a lot of debate on the ""lifting"" of the CB measures and wanted to offer my own perspective.

I got quite angry and sad when i heard the news last night. I work in a place that fulfills essential functions, and I've been much, much busier than usual for the past 2 months or so, working from home not just in the day but on weeknights and weekends. I did so with the expectation that we can see *some* light at the end of the tunnel in June as we started reopening. Turns out the government has a different idea of ""start reopening"".

Social isolation is hard for me. I'm an extrovert. Not everyone here is, and that's fine, but for some people, zoom hangouts just doesn't cut it in the long run. My house is small and crowded. I get along ok with my parents/siblings but that was when we saw each other for maybe 2h a day on average. We've started quarreling more, and it's stressful. On top of that, social isolation is also affecting my dating life.

I never expected life on 2nd June to be like life in November 2019. But I expected that the Government would have taken into account the need for people to socialise. The whole point of CB was to take sudden, drastic, *short-term* measures to break the transmission chain. We have done that, and our community numbers are low. We still have new cases everyday, but these are mostly in the foreign worker community and is because we haven't tested everyone. Because of this, I was hoping that they would allow dining in for restaurants in small groups, and minimally for people to meet up in small groups.

I'm lucky enough to have a decent paying job, not affected by the CB. I know some people are suffering financially, so letting more people go to work is important. But it's just so sad that the government has not even considered how this would impact people mentally.

I couldn't really sleep last night and had a bit of a panic attack, so I found a counsellor to speak to today. She helped me realise that I need to focus on my own mental well-being over my company needs or whatever others say. We drew up a list of things i can do, and I'm thinking about the options now. I'm considering renting my own place, away from my parents (which also gives my gf the option of visiting). I'm also trying to take a month or so no-pay leave from work, until we're allowed to go out again. I'm going to  spend this time on some of my other hobbies. And I'm going to spend much, much more time walking/cycling around outdoors, whether in a park or around the neighbourhood.

So for other people out there who are also struggling - remember that mental health is just as important as money and health. Look out for yourself, and consider what you need to tide through this crisis. Don't rely on others to understand your situation - the politicians don't always understand what matters to you, and random people online certainly won't. Try to focus on the things that you can control. I know I'm privileged enough that I have the resources to take time off, rent my own place, and not worry about not having a job, so you'll have to figure out what works for you.",,"Another perspective, and some advice for those who are equally angry about the ""Phase 1"" measures",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gn7zc0/another_perspective_and_some_advice_for_those_who/

I’ve seen plenty of arguments here that most people won’t even need masks as long as they’re healthy and practice good hygiene. This is also the stance MOH is taking and for the most part I agree. It’s just that this approach relies on trust. Trust that anyone who’s unwell will wear a mask and go to the doctor. But who are we kidding here. It just takes one inconsiderate person to infect 20 (note: this is hyperbole. Please don’t POFMA my ass). How much is hand washing gonna save you when the low but very real chance an infected person just coughs in your face on the train. It’s a risk going out without a mask. A risk that I think most of us are able take since most of us I guess are kinda healthy and young. Hence, even on the off chance that we do get infected, we should be able to walk out just fine. But what about those who can’t take that risk - the elderly and those with respiratory conditions. They still have to work or interact with people one way or another.

Using a global pandemic to displace foreigners from their livelihoods to score political points at an election is beyond the pale. It's too much and we should be extremely disappointed in and see through these cheap tactics for our approval. Anyone who falls for this screaming xenophobia needs a history lesson and should also understand more about how Singapore became the great nation it is today. 

We are a proud people, the few million citizens that we are, a tiny red dot that has achieved so much but no matter how proud we are, we know deep down none of it would have been possible without our friends from around the world, many of whom moved here to help us build this great country and economy. We couldn't have done it alone.

The difference between ""us"" and ""them"": these ""foreigners"" didn't get here early enough by a matter of decades, to be called citizens, and possibly now have the wrong skin colour. 

We seem to forget that we are colonisers. As a country we have barely been around for 50 years (just over a generation). This country of ours was recently Malaysia, and before that was a British trading Post founded by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, lost to the Japanese in World War 2 and reclaimed at the end of the war where the blood of British, American and Australian troops could have filled rivers in its (and South East Asia's) defense during the war. 

Many of us have grandparents who remember arriving in boats to Singapore from the South of China. The Chinese don't have ancient history here. Apart from native Malays, we are all recent immigrants to this place, and while we shouldn't feel guilty about it - there were no wars of conquest in Singapore's formation, we should harbour even just a small amount of respect for people who bring us expertise, to make our country smarter, leaving behind tax revenue and capabilities it would take us longer to acquire otherwise, even if they are only here for a short period of time. We should be beaming with pride that people want to shift their lives here to grow our country with us. Let's admit there aren't many countries in the world that foreigners want to take their talents to. Or those who are prepared to leave their families to do the jobs that quite frankly we Singaporeans don't want to or won't do.

These people aren't taking from the system, they are contributing to it. They help us innovate and grow. They make us stronger. 

Us and them should just be Us together. We are a global family now and a different mindset will send us backwards. 

But particularly appaling are these comments in light of the conditions many of our foreign workers have been exposed to in dormitories - COVID shined a bright torch on Singapore in the filthy corners and it wasn't pretty. 

Primarily we should also realise that our politicians know all of this too and any claims by them otherwise is just a tactic to win votes from people they refuse to properly educate on these matters.

9. The newbie busy working and doesn’t have the time to call for meeting (not even newbie’s job). It’s a PA job to do the call of meeting and the newbie was slapped with “in terms of position, I’m higher than you” er.....
10. People working real slow after constant chase of work.

hhwx2g,1593423608,hhwx2g,78,,"Woah. They referred to HSK as lacklustre?

&amp;#x200B;

This general election will be like no other that we have experienced,” Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, declared this week, announcing that the city-state would go to the polls on July 10th. Procedures may be a little different from usual, given the continuing outbreak of covid-19. But the outcome will be just like the previous 12 national elections: the ruling People’s Action Party (pap) will romp home with a huge majority of seats.  


The pap is a slick political machine which has held power since before independence in 1965. Its share of the popular vote has never dipped below 60%. Even at its lowest ebb, in 2011, the party retained 93% of the elected seats in Parliament. Last time around, in 2015, it won almost 70% of the popular vote, perhaps boosted by the death earlier that year of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister and the incumbent’s father.  


The pap’s popularity stems in large part from its competence. It has presided over decades of rapid economic growth, with little of the corruption that plagues neighbouring countries. But the party is too thorough to leave its prospects up to voters. It has devised an electoral system that makes life difficult for its opponents. In most constituencies a party must field a slate of four or five candidates to compete, with the winning slate taking all the seats. The need in such seats to find multiple well-known candidates, pay for all the deposits (at almost $10,000 a pop) and win over a much larger pool of voters puts a heavy burden on opposition parties. In fact, only one such constituency—Aljunied—is not in the pap’s hands, having fallen to the Workers’ Party in 2011.  


The agencies that draw electoral districts and supervise the vote are not independent, but answer to the prime minister. Exacting rules govern everything from the size and placement of signs to a ban on negative campaigning. Candidates must not say anything “that may cause racial or religious tensions or affect social cohesion”.  


The rules will be even tighter than normal this year because of the coronavirus. Rallies are banned, which is a blow to the opposition, which usually counts on big jamborees to fire up cautious voters. Instead, up to five members of a party can campaign together on “walkabouts”. Each member of the group must stay a metre away from the others and from the public, to limit potential contagion. The government will also help candidates to stream online pitches to voters. Campaigning on television and radio is strictly limited, but that did not prevent six ministers, including Mr Lee, from giving televised speeches earlier this month outlining the pap’s vision—nothing to do with the election, just part of the fight against covid-19.  


The biggest hindrance to the opposition, however, is the perpetual stifling of public debate. The constitution lists no fewer than eight different reasons why Parliament might limit freedom of speech, and it has made eager use of them. Since the previous election, the government has strengthened laws on harassment and contempt of court and dreamed up a new law to expunge online statements it deems false: the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act. A tightening of the Public Order Act requires organisers of public protests to apply for a permit at least 28 days before the event or face a fine of $14,400 or up to a year in prison, or both. The overall effect—driven home by frequent investigations and prosecutions of opposition politicians for assaults on truth and the good name of the authorities—is to discourage criticism and participation in parties other than the pap.  


Nonetheless, the opposition has won over some notable recruits. Lee Hsien Yang, the prime minister’s brother, has joined a new opposition outfit, the Progress Singapore Party (psp), which was founded last year. Its leader, Tan Cheng Bock, formerly served as an mp for the pap for 25 years but speaks now of a climate of fear in Singapore. The party wants to boost job creation, delay any rise in a nationwide goods-and-services tax for five years, and lower the voting age from 21 to 18.  


The government’s main vulnerability stems from its handling of covid-19 and the economic damage the epidemic will bring. At first Singapore was held up as a model in the battle against the disease. Then tens of thousands of cases began to emerge in dormitories for migrant workers. In total the country has seen more than 40,000 infections. In response, it imposed a “circuit breaker” from early April until mid-June during which most Singaporeans had to stay at home. Partly as a result, the government forecasts that the economy will shrink by 4-7% this year.  


The pap’s “4g” cadres—its rising fourth generation of leaders—have been given leading roles in managing the pandemic. **Their lacklustre champion, Heng Swee Keat**, the finance minister, who is expected to take over from Mr Lee during the next parliamentary term, has devised several stimulus packages worth a total of $72bn, almost 20% of gdp. More than half comes from Singapore’s formidable reserves. “Our reserves allow us to deal with this crisis from a position of strength, and give us options in a period of uncertainty like this,” he says.  


It should all be enough to retain the support of anxious voters. In recent surveys, some 80% of respondents told Blackbox, a Singaporean pollster, that the country is heading in the right direction. The real test for the pap will come after the election. A prolonged downturn will gnaw away at the basic compact between the pap and its voters, who disregard its domineering and nannyish ways because of the economic growth and social stability it has provided. Meanwhile Mr Lee has said he will retire before his 70th birthday, early in 2022.

g0jpu4,1586787222,g0jpu4,79,,"tldr: Year 1 uni student here. I stay on campus during the school term and have recently moved back. It's day 2 of moving back and I'm already breaking down because of my family. Need help.

My paternal grandma lives with us and my mother hates her. Their tension goes way back probably like 2 decades ago. So I grew up kinda walking on eggshells. I started disliking my mother in pri sch because I thought she was very negligent of me -- she never once asked about my studies and I was envious of my friends who had mothers who were so involved in their lives. Growing up we talked less and less.

I don't even know how to begin explaining this situation but I'll try:

The only person in this family who is on ok terms with my mother is my younger bro. I'm extremely convinced my mother has deeply toxic traits. She is very particular abt house cleanliness and would tell me to tell my grandma (my bro and I are always middlemen) to keep the kitchen clean and wash the hood every!time! she cooks. Whenever I try to reason with her she will DEFINITELY flare up and always always dredge up the past, launch ad hominem attacks on me (like why do you always show me attitude I am your mother) that have no relevance to the matter, and refuse to listen to any logic or to resolve whatever I tried to bring up. Quarrels like these always end in both of us crying so over the years I've learnt to keep quiet as much as possible and to turn a blind eye to the things she does. But I notice that this has unknowingly inflicted a lot of psychological trauma on me. Whenever she returns home from work I would hear the keys and my chest would tighten. A few times I would dream of her and wake up crying.

Part of the reason why I chose to stay on campus in uni is because it's like out of sight out of mind. But here's the big problem: for as long as my mother stays at home with the rest of my family, it's awfully painful to watch. A few weeks ago my father wanted to bring us out to celebrate my bro's bday, and my grandma decided to stay home at the very last minute when she learnt that my mother was gonna meet us there at dinner. Later at night my bro cried and confided in me that he was extremely tired. My father has stopped talking to my mother long ago and they sleep separately, and I know the emotional toll it has on him.

The one I feel the worst for though, is my grandma. She took care of me all my life and it sucks to see her live in fear of my mother every day. She has already changed her ways of cooking to use less oil (we moved house 2 years ago which was when my mother's crazy kitchen cleanliness expectations began) &amp; stopped frying things altogether. Now with COVID and everybody staying home, my grandma literally stays in the room all day to avoid my mother. So here's what I did. My mother was watching TV and my grandma usually watches channel 8 shows at night. So from my room, I texted her asking whether she could let my grandma watch TV at 9pm. Simple and straightforward request right? And guess what, she immediately went on a spiel on how my grandma literally does nothing except sits in her room all day and how she must have spoken badly of her behind her back. So I clarified that she hides in her room because she's fearful (to which she asked why would my grandma be if she has done nothing wrong like biiiitch) and I requested the TV on my own accord not because my grandma was somehow bitching about anything. \*more ad hominem attacks\* No TV.

It hurts. It hurts so much. Idk why I am so easily affected by my mother's words. We barely talk but when we do it always sends me down a thought spiral and makes me cry. So here I am, typing this out, teary-eyed with nowhere to go because of COVID and no privacy to let it out or call somebody because everyone is at home. I don't want the rest of my family to know I'm upset because this is additional emotional labour on them -- they are also tired this family dynamic.

It's only my 2nd day home and I'm moving back to campus in Aug. I feel like I cannot go on anymore. I'm tired of walking on eggshells and having all these crazy shit bog me down and distracting me from studying. I'm posting this on this subreddit because idk where else to turn to for help. I need both short and long term advice. Short term: I definitely need therapy to work out years and years of damage, and judging by my reaction today I need it urgently. I know of generic helplines I can call but it'll be nice if someone (with experience) can direct me to something useful and specific. Cost is a concern since I'm just a uni student and I'm funding this on my own. Long term: What do I do with a toxic family? It seems like the tension between my mother and grandma cannot be resolved and I've come to a point of acceptance already (my bro hasn't though). If I could move out right now and cut ties with her I totally would but the thing is, the rest of my loved ones will continue to suffer in the house. This thought bogs me down every day because it's one thing to be in pain yourself but it's even more painful to see your loved ones hurting. It's much more complicated if the toxic person is your family member not a friend or a partner. So to anyone out there who has grown up with a toxic parent, please share.

Well it has been 1.5h since the whole episode started and I lowkey regret sending the message to make my grandma a little happier. I'm still crying and I hate that I'm like this. My mother is literally incapable of proper reasoning and jumps to her defenses SO FAST. Idk how to leave the room and face her now. I'm already dealing with anxiety issues and there's this. I'm fucking tired.

Edit: Some of you have pointed out that I should involve my father in this. During a fight between my mother and I last year he told me that when push comes to shove one day, he will get a divorce, though that is really the last resort, especially since my bro will be caught in the middle. My bro feels some obligation towards her because he's like the only family member she talks to and worries that she'll do something stupid if someone were to raise divorce.

I’ve seen comments on how when Shanmugam chimed in it was basically the kickoff for the elections, while that is true, or whether or not TWM had senior support for his original post, I don’t think they expected the number of people pointing out the inconsistencies and for both Pritam and Alfian to respond with the force and grace they did, and for that many people to rally behind them.

This period is surely a tough time for most couples who are getting used to seeing their SO less often.

I have friends who have broken up because the time away from each other allowed them the headspace to reconsider their relationships, which led them to realised they were actually not compatible.

What are your experiences, if any? What did you realise about your SO that led to the break up, or considering to break up?

LDR experiences are also welcomed to share. I would considered this CB period as LDR because it's essentially the same: no physical contact and rely on video calls or texting to maintain the relationship.

2) Bring your own container when you dabao food. If you aren't carrying too many stuff already it's not too hard to bring along a reusable container to dabao food.

I am currently in Stockholm, Sweden for an exchange programme. I live outside the city with 3 other Singaporean housemates, 2 of which don't seem to take this virus seriously, wearing masks seem to be a bullet-proof option to them, when the right way to protect ourselves should be to practice social distancing and halting any non-essential travel. 

One of them has their whole extended family coming over for a holiday tomorrow and they will be touring the city, visiting attractions and whatnot. With the situation in Stockholm becoming more and more dire by the day, and the local government basically halting tests for non-hospital cases, the numbers seem artificially low.

i61zbc,1596904134,i61zbc,84,,"(Copy pasta from her FB) 

I have been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy.

It is a rather nasty brain disease which starts with a Parkinson’s-like illness that slows physical movements, impairs fast eye movements and balance, resulting in a tendency to fall. This is followed by difficulty swallowing, choking aspiration, pneumonia and death – for the fortunate.

Further progression of the disease will lead to dementia with prominent behavioural changes such as disinhibition and impulsivity.

My immediate reaction to the news was “忍”(ren),  or endure in Chinese, of which the traditional character has a knife above a heart.  I have been practicing “忍” since I was in Chinese school, recognising that life has many unpleasant, unavoidable situations.

It would be nice if this entire episode turns out to be a nightmare and that I will wake up. But it is getting increasingly real and inescapable every day.  My movements are slow and hesitant and I have difficulty getting up from my futon (yes, I upgraded from sleeping on  
two exercise mats, one on top of the other, to a comfortable futon on top of the exercise mats).

The futon was what my brother Hsien Yang’s kids would use when they had friends sleep over.  It gives more cushioning than just exercise mats and the surface is made of woven bamboo strips, making it cool and easy to slide on.

But it cannot compare to Zee.dog, the mattress my Shiba Inu puppy sleeps on. I watch with envy as he sleeps like a king, lying flat on his back with his belly exposed – a sign my dog trainer interprets as being totally relax and confident enough to expose his vulnerable abdomen.  I had googled Zee.dog bed and was informed that “your pet dog spends 80 per cent of its life sleeping.  The Zeebed was designed to be the world’s most comfortable dog bed.”8 Even my helper knew about the brand. She said her previous employer’s dog slept on just such a bed.

The next question is “Why me?"" but I did not ask it because the obvious answer was “Why not?"". I have had it good for too long.

I was born into a middle class family with sensible parents that did not want their children brought up as rich and privileged. My father was Prime Minister of Singapore and we could have stayed in a huge bungalow in the Istana grounds. But he did not want us growing up with the wrong idea of our importance and entitlement. He did not like the idea that if we threw a ball, a butler would run to get it. So we lived in our old pre-war home at Oxley Road.

We played with the butler’s children as equals and watched their little television set in their sitting room as their equals. This relationship was maintained through the years and even now, if we happen to cross paths, we greet each other as childhood friends and on first name basis. Over the years I have seen Flora and Stella when their children were admitted to the hospital, usually for asthmatic attacks. John and Aloysius, I have not seen for a long time.

I enjoyed school — both academically and socially — I even represented Raffles Institution in athletics and swimming. After my “A” level exams, I did well enough to earn a President’s scholarship and was admitted to medical school. Again I did well academically and topped  
my cohort.

My first taste of failure was at the MRCP (Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians) exams. A day after the results were announced, almost all Singapore doctors knew I failed and cheered. That was an important lesson in resilience. I took the exams again and passed it this time.

I chose to specialise in paediatrics because I had initially wanted to do veterinary medicine but was dissuaded by my parents. The challenges of paediatrics and veterinary medicine is similar — in the two, doctors deal with with patients who cannot convey their problems clearly and concisely, and in both, patients may be uncooperative without deliberately being nasty. I then chose to subspecialise in paediatric neurology and was awarded a Health Ministry scholarship for 3 years, training at Massachusetts General Hospital a famous hospital in Boston.

On my return, I served my 13-year bond. Unfortunately, I was not really wanted at the paediatric department and was transferred to the neurology department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. I was the only paediatric neurologist amongst a group of adultneurologists. When the neurogroup Of TTSH AND SGH

As epilepsy is the only neurological condition that was treatable at that time, I delved into paediatric epilepsy, which has a wider range of manifestation than adult epilepsy and I became competent as a paediatric and adult epileptologist. I was subsequently given another Health Ministry scholarship and spent one year at the Toronto Hospital for sick children and a few months at the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. Each scholarship came with a bond and I served a total of between 15 and 17 years.

I came about half an hour early and you were sitting there on the other side of the bench. I didn’t really pay you any attention. I had my ear piece on and was probably listening to Taylor Swift.

g6fqij,1587613712,g6fqij,86,,"Decided to write this post to address a lot of flaming of young parents (i.e. with kids under 12) especially during this period.

I was largely inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g6aq8h/i_have_no_words/). Don't understand the rampant virtue signaling and holier-than-thou attitude which doesn't help anyone. Everyone is badly affected by COVID so just have some empathy and let people rant and reserve judgement, even if it's not completely rational and selfish at times. Deep inside I'm sure all of us are guilty as well about feeling unhappy that our freedoms are curtailed.

Anyway I will list a few common variants of comments often seen on this sub and address them systematically.

**“Parents nowadays too reliant on childcare, maid, grandparents, etc”**

Let’s first address the reliance on caregivers. 

Fundamentally, I believe that parents cannot be reasonably expected to attend to their child’s needs while also meeting work expectations of an employee during office hours and progressing in their career. Hence, the reliance is an absolute necessity if both parents are working full-time. 

As the saying goes, “it takes a village to raise a child” and in the past, what people did was to just leave their kids with a relative or to run around in the kampung with the other kids with little care to whether they got kidnapped/gored by a wild boar/their neck broken by falling in a ditch etc. Now obviously you will see some shows where the single mother carries the baby in a bamboo basket and plucks herbs/runs some restaurant at the same time. Wow! Try doing that in your office job.

The other option is single income with one homemaker. And unfortunately it is not financially viable for the vast majority of families to subsist on a single income in Singapore (and pretty much everywhere else as well). Even a parent taking a childcare break for a few years can have a devastating effect on future income and savings and completely derail a career.

**“Nowadays parents don’t spend time with their kids and outsource everything. They will be neglected and become degenerates in the future”**

This is related to the first point, the outsourcing part has been addressed. I think the main overgeneralization is that parents who want their kids out of their face during office hours are going to continue ignoring their kids after that. Yes, there are a number of parents like that but there are also a lot of parents who are happy to play with their kids at the end of the day. Research has shown that quality time is important to children and not absolute quantity ([https://hbr.org/2018/11/how-our-careers-affect-our-children](https://hbr.org/2018/11/how-our-careers-affect-our-children)).

Also, in my experience the vast majority of the neglected kids act out during school years but eventually most still grow up to be economically productive (if psychologically unhealthy) citizens.The roots of this problem lie deeper, I personally feel that Singapore has a strong culture of toxic shame which has been passed down from generation to generation, leading to poor psychological health at a population level and thus people who are less well equipped to be parents in general.

But no society is not going to collapse, especially considering how many from our generation are /r/raisedbynarcissists and we are still doing fine.

**“Why have kids if you don’t want to take care of them so irresponsible tsk tsk tsk”**

The issue here is that for parents who are WFH during the CB you are expected to both care for the kid at home while performing 100% of your regular work duties (unless your company is ‘understanding’). So that is essentially a +50% burden with 2 parents WFH and +100% if one parent is essential and working away from home. Also, childcare centres were still charging 100% fees during CB which was only recently cut by 50% due to government intervention.

IMO this statement is the equivalent of “Why work in F&amp;B if you don’t want to take a pay cut and work 50% more hours”, “Why work in healthcare if you don’t want to have extended hours, leave cancellation, elevated COVID risk”, “Why work as a taxi driver if you don’t want to take 90% paycut”. Everyone didn’t sign up for this shit but I’m sure we all recognize these statements are insensitive so how about applying the same standard to WFH parents?

**“If your kids cannot keep themselves entertained and you cannot perform WFH at your regular capacity you are a terrible parent“**

Kids above 6 might be (semi) independent but those 2+-5 need constant attention (unless watching iPad the whole day) and those under that need constant supervision before they kill themselves in the 5-10 seconds you look away. It can be extremely challenging and stressful to juggle these duties and work at the same time (not to mention securing food, housework, etc especially those who don’t have a helper).

**“Parents nowadays have kids as an insurance policy when they are old”**

I seriously LOL every time I see an argument like that. Certainly there are boomers that treat their kids like an ATM but the idea that financially pragmatic young Singaporeans would dump immense sums of money into an investment with the hope that it will pay some dividend scraps 30 years down the road is just laughable, you are better off dumping it into an ILP or the altcoin/shitcoin flavor of the month.",,Addressing common criticisms directed at young parents,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g6fqij/addressing_common_criticisms_directed_at_young/

However, we are to expect worse days ahead and even deaths to be reported. Yet I see long queues for food at many places, and also comments like ""It's just the flu"" which are meant to assure people and reduce panic.

While I do not agree with supermarket runs and other selfish behaviour, I think we do need to at least a little bit more concerned about Covid19. Here's why:

* It's not just the elderly and those with existing medical conditions who will be critically ill. Even the young and healthy (except perhaps little children) can have their immune systems go into overdrive and attack their organs.  [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/).
* Dr Richard Hatchett--Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations--wiho has 20 years of experience dealing with infectious diseases considers Covid19 to be more frightening than Ebola, MERS and Sars due to its infectiousness and much higher fatality rate than flu (compared to what was initially predicted). [https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs](https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs) 
* Even if local healthcare is capable of handling Covid19, it will not be able to do so if hospitals are overwhelmed by huge numbers of cases. This is what happened in Wuhan and is happening in Italy.  I find this report by a surgeon in Italy to be extremely compelling and moving: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony\_of\_a\_surgeon\_working\_in\_bergamo\_in\_the/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

So can we all be at least a bit more concerned and continue to play our part in fighting this virus? We will not win the war by panicking and stockpiling; by blaming governments and countries, people of various races, etc. This is a global war! Be vigilant but stay calm. Stay home if you have even just some respiratory symptoms (and isolate from family members if need be) and see a doctor immediately if it worsens.

iebqzr,1598068582,iebqzr,87,,"I am curious about how school routines have changed for the different tertiary schools due to the COVID-19 situation! I'll kickstart the sharing with how NTU is like now.

​

# NTU

* Safe entry to every school building/foodcourt, but you are free to roam about the common areas
* Most lectures were pushed online with tutorials/labs still conducted in physical classes
* No standing in campus buses (Because COVID-19 only affects those who stand, right?)

**My observations:**

It feels like the week before finals even though we have only started the semester. Students are crowding everywhere from school buildings to common areas for their online lessons. Apparently lectures were shifted online to facilitate ""safe distancing"" and reduce the number of students on campus, but this has backfired for a simple reason - Tutorials and labs are still conducted in person.

Most students have a mix of both online and physical lessons in a single day, with little breaks between them. To illustrate what I mean, imagine you have an online class in the morning followed by a 1 hour break before your physical class starts. If you stay &gt;1 hour away from NTU (which is very common), you have no choice but to camp in school for your online class as you will be late for your physical class if you came from home after the online class. I guess this is the main reason why we see common areas flooded with students at any time of the day.

**NTU has a standing agreement with COVID-19 to not infect students who are sitting down on campus buses**

But NTU should learn from LTA/SBS/SMRT as they have signed a better contract with COVID-19 to not infect anyone on board their transportation mediums, regardless of whether they're standing or sitting.",,"Tertiary students of Singapore, what is school like for you now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iebqzr/tertiary_students_of_singapore_what_is_school/

N95 provided better protection than medical masks (aka surgeon masks). However, researchers of this meta-analysis also found the multiple studies informing this conclusion had all kinds of limitations and errors like self-reporting, inconsistent use of masks across subjects, poor auditing, lack of control group, etc. Many of the studies were retrospective observational studies after SARS and other outbreaks and not tightly controlled clinical trials. 

Still, the evidence is encouraging.

* **...however, masks offer protection only under perfect use.**

What does this mean? All N95 and medical masks are not created equal. We all have different face shapes, nose and mouth sizes, jaw lines. There are endless brands of medical masks and N95s. Proper fit is critical to ensure protection. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23210700) observed 84 nursing students with no prior experience with or knowledge of N95 masks. They were split into groups. Some groups were received training on how to properly fit and use the masks, while other groups were not. The study found a statistically significant difference (aka probably not chance) in ambient air particles between the trained and untrained groups. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980503) followed healthcare workers with no fit-test training for 14 months. Less than 50% of subjects formed an adequate seal. Even after proper training, a group of healthcare workers had to try different masks to ensure an adequate fit. Keep in mind these are nursing students and healthcare workers, and studies are *still* suggesting difficulty ensuring proper use. In other words, there's a very high probability that you, your loved ones, and all the people around you are not using masks properly.

So the way us normal peasants use it, it might not be so effective. That might be way many health authorities tell us not to bother with masks. You're going to be taking it off and fidgeting with it and leaving air holes all over the place to avoid that slimy layer of nasty, post-prawn mee breath saliva condensation on the lower half of our face. And this is true. I was walking around today at the airport and the use of masks were really... just anyhow.

* **Ah ha! So masks are BS, right? These mask people are paranoid and stupid, right???**

Okay, hang on, you darn ""I told you so"" crowd. Not so fast. Sure masks might not be so effective as limited protection. However, placebo effect is important. I'm not saying placebo effect will ward off 2019-nCoV in any way, no. But it does ward off something else destructive: fear. It wards off fear. You put on that mask, and there's that tiny ray of light piercing into the dark depths of anxiety and fear. Sweet relief. And the weird thing about placebo? It still works even if you know it's all just a sham. Always being fearful and worrying puts your body under a constant state of stress. This [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361287/) of 300 studies across 30 years show that stress does diminish our immune system’s ability to respond to diseases. Short bursts of stress -- we’re talking minutes -- triggers adrenaline and boosts our performance. Chronic stress over a long timeline will start to affect our immune system, and not in a good way. And last I checked, there was no expiration date on the Wuhan virus.

It’s important to understand there aren’t any magical, one-size-fits-all protection against this virus. It’s going to take a combination of proper use of masks, good hand washing habits, avoiding sick people, and a bit of luck. You can get the best fitted mask and wear it properly for 16 hours out of the day, but if you have crappy hand washing techniques, the moment you wipe your lips, pick your nose, or rub your eye, all those endless hours of discomfort and gross, hot breath will mean fuck all.

**So... to wrap up...**

Be patient. There are so many unknowns about this virus, and science is a painstakingly difficult process. One mistake and you’ve wasted time and millions of dollars on the wrong vaccine. Or you’ve overreacted and wrecked your economy with an overzealous policy. There are real consequences that may even be worse than this coronavirus can ever hope to do.

glb3r1,1589699381,glb3r1,90,,"This is my experience with Technofied Vision, and why I feel everyone should **steer clear** of this company at all cost. 

***TDLR Below.***

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some context:

*I've been experiencing issues with my PC, namely a boot loop that crashes whenever I try to boot it up, I was not able to boot it up without crashing during the boot and restarting. Back then I wasn't sure what was the main issue that was causing it.*  


On the **17/04/2020,** I went down to Technofied Vision Pte Ltd, as it was one of the only IT services that were supposedly open during the COVID-19 period and near where I lived. I went down with my computer trying to get them to fix the issue I was facing.

First, I was greeted by their receptionist, an Indian lady. She asked what issue was I facing with my computer and I told her what I listed above and I didn't know what was the main issue either. After telling her she told me it might be a CPU issue, which I didn't really understand, I question her further for more details and she changed her answer to ""we will only know till our IT specialist works on it"". 

Now I was going back and forth with her trying to get an answer and even asked for a manager to talk to, as based on their website and details about their company, they stated they have 20 years of professional IT services and tens of thousands of happy customers. Thinking they have such profound experience I was trying to get a quote, assuming they would have experienced a similar or closely related issues based on what I described.

The manager told me that they weren't unable to give me a quote before diagnosing the issue, which requires me to pay a fee. I was a little persistent as I was desperate and also strapped on cash at that moment in time. I may have been a little pushy towards getting an answer. After talking to the manager I decided to get my computer fix at Technofied Vision and paid **a non-refundable** **deposit** of **$102.80** for the diagnosis on what issue I was facing and wait for the total price of the fixing of the PC later down the line. And I was told that they would work on it ASAP.

In hindsight, it should have been a red flag for me to head elsewhere for an initial diagnosis. 

Around 2 days later I received the news of the issue of my PC which was a corrupted window, repairing it would set me back a total of $250 including the initial deposit. I agreed as I've already sunk $100 with the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

On **23/04/2020** I was told to collect my PC as it was fixed. I head down and was told of the issue and what they did to fix it.

The IT guy told me the issue was the corrupted window and they had to remove my graphics card as it was causing the boot loops, he also mentioned that they had to remove my HDD as it was causing lag for my computer. Upon hearing that I was curious how a hard disk could lag a PC as I was not too experienced in electronics, however before I could question the IT guy, I was told he left and he will be back at 2 PM, I was there around 12 PM. I was bewildered, I went to check on my PC at the establishment, which was booting up alright, however, I could not post my questions to anyone as the person who could answer any of them left. I was obviously frustrated at this. On the same day, I decided to leave a review on Google of 1 out of 5 stars describing my experience which left me frustrated. 

Deciding there's nothing much to do but to head back home. Thinking everything was fixed but the experience left a sour taste in my mouth. As I head home I opened the PC to find the HDD has been disconnected, I reconnected the cable and boot my PC back up and I did not experience any lag. With the removal of the graphics card which was causing the issue, I decided to get a new card from a friend which would only arrive on May 15th. 

I did not use the PC till then and went use a laptop to do my work on instead. 

**15/05/2020** After getting the new graphics card and installing it, everything went smoothly. However, I started to find issues with my computer. 

One was the drivers which were not updated to the current version, comprising of 15 over updates that took me a few hours to complete, after that things went smoothly thinking that despite the horrible experience I was able to use my PC.

This is when it gets weird, I received a call from Technofied Vision in the evening from the manager, stating I have to remove the review I left on Google as his **lawyer** told him that my comment was causing defamation toward their company and if I do not wish to have this issue escalated further I have to delete my review. I told him that I felt the experience I got at the establishment was not something I wish to experience again and it was in my opinion, he kept pushing and telling me to remove and even asking if he could speak to my parents or my company director. I told him no and said I'm not removing the review and to not call me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have since found multiple reviews and a post on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/d73ifj/technofied_vision_anybody/), that pointed out the non-refundable deposit and to stay away from Technofied Vision. Even a review accounting how they received a similar call regarding a negative review they posted and was told to remove it in light of facing legal action and even receive an email from their 'lawyer', and the reviewer replied the given lawyer's email it bounced, stating the email address given to most likely be fake.

And now after installing my new graphics cards into my supposedly *fixed* PC and updating all drivers, my computer still crashes and loops during boot. 

Thus I **do not recommend** going to Technofied Vision for any repairs or service ever. This my experience and I do not want anyone to experience what I did with Technofied Vision P

I was on the MRT train today and a middle aged uncle was blatantly coughing with his head up, without covering his mouth. The surrounding passengers were clearly very uncomfortable and some moved away. 5 minutes later, a brave lad confronted him and told him to please at least cough into his arm or into the corner, or consider taking a taxi home.

The reply was outrageous - in hokkien, it went along the lines of ""I cough is my own daiji, i want take MRT also my own daiji, you not happy?""

I feel this sort of behaviour warrants an arrest and fine. Just imagine if, given our current pandemic situation, someone coughed/sneezed infront of your face and you can feel the spit landing on you. I'd be freaked out honestly.

Back to the title - if there is video evidence that you went out to crowded, public areas, and started coughing or sneezing without any intention to cover up, this should get you arrested and slapped with, minimally, a probation order or 14 day SHN with a fine.

In fact, if you are having a fever and you are aware that you have an ongoing cough or flu symptom, going out in public should be a criminal offence",,"Opinion: (Intentionally) Coughing in Public should get you arrested, change my mind",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fqdf50/opinion_intentionally_coughing_in_public_should/

As usual, I am here to answer all your dental related questions. Remember they don't have to be serious questions. In view of the current situation, feel free to ask more light-hearted, random questions to lighten up the mood!

During this Circuit Breaker period in Singapore, dental clinics are still operational as we are considered an essential service, however we are all given strict orders from the Ministry of Health to see and treat patients only if they are in urgent need of attention: usually pain related and loss of function.

The idea is the minimise risk of the virus spreading by limiting the need for anyone to leave the house. That basically means all your routine cleans, check-ups, non-urgent treatments like fillings, aesthetic procedures like whitening etc. will all be postponed under this whole thing is over.

In light of this, **I wanted to provide this opportunity for you Singapore Redditors to ask any dental related questions you might have. If you have a dental problem, or not sure if your issue is serious enough to need urgent attention from your own dentist, feel free to ask away, or PM me if you prefer.** Do note that I am doing this entirely voluntarily in nature. I may not be able to get to all of your questions but I will try my best!

*""I don't believe that Wonderboy Jamus can pull off a ""Tharman"" at Sengkang either. But WP will surely get some NCMP seats and they will almost certainly give one to the Wonderboy, so he is in good hands.""*

**Maybe I'm being uptight but it sounds quite disrespectful/fake to label someone ""wonder boy"". It's not a sign of mature discussion.**

*""if an elderly could not find any suitable job to sustain themselves, what would they do then?""*

*My point exactly. Talk is cheap. What other kinds of productive work do people have for them?*

*So we think it's better to just pay them off to sit at home every month. Actually can be done and has been done. I have worked with the VWOs for 15 years and I have visited these homes. Has Jamus done the same?📷* *You know what's 纸上谈兵?*

**Well, maybe Jamus has done other things, have explored economic policy which is his field? Why so condescending?**

*People think that MSF has been sleeping all these years? Just that dun have a loud mouth like me stand up to scold these people for them only. The guy who kenna the most sai is TCJ. I feel damn sorry for him.*

**Sounds like the same kind of person who would say people are poor because they don't work? And nobody is saying the MSF has been sleeping, but people are concerned with things like ageism, the inability of the old to support themselves with extremely low-paid jobs, poverty, etc.**

J*esus said, ""The poor you will always have with you.""*

*He wasn't kidding. Poverty is a v complex problem that strangely cannot be solved with just money. We have too many armchair critics who only know how to talk. If you want to solve the problem, I suggest you go and do more and understand what the hell is going on and come up with a workable plan. Don't just stand around and tell the Government to do more. We are dealing with v complex problems and it's not simply a matter of ""doing more"".*

**I think spotting issues, finding what circumstances we as a society can and cannot accept is just as important as solutions. In fact, even more important - there are certain things we do not like, certain things we would like to see change in, certain issues we spot, which we identify during normal political discourse and convey through our vote, and we then give power, and money, to politicians and the government to engage experts to work on them. It's great if we can come out with solutions ourselves, but most of us lack the expertise to. Doesn't mean we can't talk about them or raise awareness; we can all know something is an elephant when we see one, and it's enough that we're given options to vote on/consider.**

*Our healthcare spending also among the lowest in the world on per capita basis. Trumpland among the highest in the world. People should all run to safety in Trumpland given COVID19!! Have you booked your flight yet?*

**It's irritating to see him so immaturely calling names in a very civilized discussion. One can call it America, USA, it's so distasteful to resort to name calling, especially when he's conversing with his students. Also why always compare to America?**

*Since you asked nicely, let me try to explain it to you....To be fair to Wonderboy, he has no experience in government so we can give him some slack. But the Opposition does have some ex-AOs like Hazel Poa and Benjamin Pwee. They should be able to do better. However, still cannot make it by my standards...""in our haste to write off “falling labour share” as inconsequential,""Who is writing off what as inconsequential? Your forgot abut Gini Coefficient. Our public service has much better economists than Jamus. But I also argue with them and half the time I also dun agree with them. Everything that Jamus knows I guarantee you that they already know and have discussed.*

\- Everyone knows politics is a matter of competing values, when people argue in politics it's about difference in values, whether in cost-benefit analysis or other values. No need to act so condescending.

\- The civil service (or more accurately the government) settles on a certain conclusion, but the point of opposition members is to probe at this conclusion, and if they have knowledge in that area that will be even more helpful.

\- I'm no economist but there's nothing wrong with pointing out differences in labour share. He says Jamus doesn't think about context, but anyone who is arguing that there is too low a wage share has in mind context - e.g. the type of industries we have, as suggested by Ben Leong? I cannot quite grasp his counter arguments at times, especially when he throws in things like ""compare fingernails lor"" or ""compare our foot"". He thinks everything Jamus is saying is wrong

*The way we should do policy is figure out what the problem is, figure out how to solve it, figure out how much it's going to cost us and find money for it.*

*-* I mean, duh, but this is also a disingenuous way of rejecting arguments. Obviously one can say raise taxes on the rich (which is controversial in itself), but there's a more fundamental argument being made here: lower wage and labour share indicates lower worker bargaining power, which is usually associated with less productive workers - it's calling for a rethink of how we operate labour policy. It's calling for a rethink about what rights/outcomes we deem important in a society, and identifying that is important, and to fulfill that can be done be reallocating budget, taxes, generating greater national income through state investment, using our reserves etc. I'm not advocating for any particular form, but I'm just hoping to say that thinking about the problem is important.

It's on the fb post saying:

Agree with this analysis.

My preferred outcome is status quo: WP keeps Aljunied and Hougang.

Would be good to see Paul in Parliament, but he is with the wrong party, so I suspect the odds are not in his favour. But I suspect that he will end up as an NCMP, which is probably fine also.

ht9nzu,1595042084,ht9nzu,92,,"I am writing this to raise awareness to more people regarding this issue and to also urge you guys to look out for your community cats. This issue of stray dogs coming into HDB estates to maul community cats has been happening islandwide, particularly in Woodlands, Marsiling, Punggol and Tampines area. There has been an odd rise in such cases happening since the Circuit Breaker period, where stray dog packs are seen roaming around different HDB estates everyday and there is reported to be at least one mauling case happening in the mentioned areas every single day. Now that Phase 2 is here, we thought that this issue would die down and the dogs will no longer appear (due to more people going outside and also regular feeders of these dogs coming back), it turns out that the situation is actually not getting better as there are still mauling cases reported these past few days. 
The cat feeders (myself included) have been trying to bring their community cats home every night to keep them safe, some have started fundraisers to keep them in shelters, some have been staying downstairs every night at 2-3am to make sure these dogs do not come around. I have been in contact with NParks regarding this issue since May, which shows that we have been doing this for TWO MONTHS EVERYDAY. Our ability to WFH has already been long gone and most of us cannot continue to look out for these cats every night because of how tiring it is. 
I have reached out to NParks, CWS, SPCA and also my estate's GRC. NParks has been telling me that they will trap these dogs (under their TNRM programme) and has worked with dog welfare organisations to do so, but their trapping is so SLOW even though residents have reported to see the dogs every night. They told me that they have actually received reports regarding such cases since FEB, which proves their inactivity even more. In my area, during these two months, only four dogs have been caught so far. Don't even get me started on how many dogs are still around. The others that I've mentioned have just expressed their inability to help, while CWS has only released information teaching individuals how they can protect themselves when they are approached by stray dogs, which has nothing to do with this issue concerning the cats. 
Before you comment that this is all ""due to nature"" and ""the dogs are just hungry"", residents in the Marsiling area are actually feeding the dogs every time they see them around. Food is also placed around elsewhere to assist the trapping. It is not all the time that these dogs are here just because they're hungry. I can't argue that it is due to their nature instincts to hunt cats as prey, but then again we are talking about the significant rise in such cases happening during this period, which can pose as a harm to both residents and community cats. 
I have urged everyone who's witnessed such cases to write into the above organisations mentioned and despite the number of reports made, it seems like this problem is still nowhere to be resolved, which is why I am resorting to talk about this here and also other social media platforms to hopefully get this issue known to people around. 
I will not attach any of the sightings reported by residents throughout these two months as I do not have a proper compilation of all of them, but they are usually posted in the community cat groups on Facebook (I can drop you a PM if you'd like to know which one), and most of them are actually removed due to hate comments from animal/dog lovers who are against the TNRM programme. If this issue remains unknown to most individuals and there is little to no action taken, this problem will just continue to arise. 
TLDR: I urge everyone to be aware of the significant rise in cases of community cats being mauled by stray dogs islandwide possibly due to CB period, and such cases are still happening even though Phase 2 has started, and the response by the relevant organisations has been slow/non-existent. 
If there is anyone who can provide your views on how we can otherwise tackle this problem as well as continue to ensure these cats' safety and not further tire ourselves out, we would greatly appreciate it.",,Increasing cases of community cats being mauled by stray dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ht9nzu/increasing_cases_of_community_cats_being_mauled/

I'm stuck in a role for nearly 4 years with no signs of progression and even there is a chance for a progress change in roles within my company, the increment will still be poor or non existent due to Covid and the future skillset is utterly worthless due to how niche it is in Singapore.

I know its a extremely bad idea to quit one's job now during this pandemic but everyday being handcuffed down to my job for constant income is currently taking a toll on my mental health because at my age I need to start saving up for a BTO, give my parents allowances along with paying my bills and insurances which my current salary can't suffice in the future.

I'm really at my wits end. Its been gnawing at the back of head that I can't enjoy my normal activities, been sleeping a lot with depression and fears of either stuck a low paying dead end job forever or not finding a new job with no experience or relevant skillset.

Initially it started with the job, then soon after things just started going downhill from there. I’ve dreaded this job for a while now, i dont exactly enjoy it, most of the time i feel lost and just don’t feel like its a right fit for me. My physical health has also taken a hit, for the past month i’ve felt nausea in the morning, chest feels heavy, lack of appetite, fatigue and its terrible. 

Tired of feeling this way, i decided to take the first step to seek help by visiting a doctor and then a counsellor. And after talking to some close people around me, i’ve finally decided to quit my job. Im going to tender tomorrow, and i have a few questions that i would like to ask:

1) Do i have to feel bad about suddenly quitting like this? Other than my usual duties, i have a few things im involved in, so does that make me look irresponsible?

2) How do i break this to my supervisor? I intend to say that the job just isnt a good fit for me. But should i include that its been affecting my mental health as well? Cos i would prefer not to tbh

Thanks for reading this, and i would really appreciate any advice.

There was some US housing issue + the Lehman Brothers-Merill Lynch thing and that caused some trickle-down effects on global economy. But I personally didn’t feel any effects of it. Or maybe I did, but I was too ignorant/not bothered. 

But after stepping into the working world, I realized that every salaried employee is subjected to the ebbs and flows of the economy, just to what extent. Even if you are in the public sector, you are still at the mercy of the economy when you want to change jobs, etc. 

IMF has already cautioned that the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will surpass that of the Great Depression of the 1930s. But because a vast majority of people have not lived through the experiences of the Great Depression, the 2008 recession has always been cited as a comparison model. 

Frankly, its scary how things unfolded. The Singapore Government has never announced such a huge stimulus package, not even during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. To me, it is a sign that things won’t go well. :(

While admittedly I'm not like the significant proportion of the Singapore Reddit community that completely oppose the death penalty, I am completely against this particular instance involving Syed Suhail.

The current coronavirus case makes it all the more unfair that he's being executed on such a short notice (8 days, if I remember correctly?). Furthermore, I do feel that his case warrants a commutation of his sentence to be reduced. Even if reduced to life imprisonment, that's already better than getting hanged.

It's not like he's a criminal boss or a big-time drug runner. Also, to put it in a way, in this instance he's a product of the shortcomings of Singapore's systems. I don't think it's right for the country to kill its own citizens because of its own shortcomings.

Local figures like Kirsten Han and Subhas have also taken to social media to raise awareness on the issue, in hopes that Syed Suhail's death sentence will be commuted. Wakeupsingapore (as much as I hate that Instagram page) has also shared some posts relating to the death sentence.

The queues are so long, that people have to queue outside. The police have to intervene for crowd control and make sure people practice social distancing. 

People are not listening to the limits set. For eg., each person can only get 2 packs of instant noodles and 6 canned food. If you want to get more, you have to re-queue. And, you cannot use your link card for the second transaction. Please read and understand  the limitations before you reach the cashier counter.

You do realise that a lot of the older generation DID grow up in a Singapore where you HAD to be selfish to thrive? Us youths of today do indeed have the luxury of ""giving back"" and I feel that we absolutely should, but using the same yardstick to measure the behaviour of uncles/aunties who grew up in the 60s/70s is hardly judging them fairly. Some of these people attended primary school with no money to eat anything at all during recess, and even those who were slightly better off had to scrimp and save to be able to afford what we would consider an ""average"" meal by today's standards. My mother used to tell me how chinese new year nowadays doesn't feel as special to her anymore, because nowadays anytime she want something (goodies, new clothes, etc.), she can just go out and buy. When she was young, CNY was the ONLY time the entire year where she could get a new toy, or nice new clothes, and eat slightly better meals. Just want to note here that my family hasn't been hoarding groceries like a lot of people, but if my parents decided to I wouldn't have judged them poorly. I would have advised them against it, but wouldn't have thought any poorer of them if they decided to.

Yes you can argue that uncles/aunties should be able to see that we are much more better off now, and that they don't need to be so selfish. But your upbringing sticks with you very deeply, something that younger members of this sub probably don't understand yet. If you grow up constantly starving, you're not going to forget the feeling of starving. If you grow up having to constantly scrimp, save and hoard, you're not going to give that up easily, ESPECIALLY in times of crisis like this virus spreading.

**On top of all this, it's not like such behaviour is unique to Singaporeans to begin with, because selfish behaviour is seen all around the world.** I'm just really fucking baffled by the narrow-mindedness of the people criticising Singaporeans specifically as if we're SIGNFICIANTLY worse than every other country in the world.

**To clarify, I am not defending the behaviour of selfish Singaporeans or mask/grocery hoarders. I too believe that they're causing more harm than good to society through their actions as well.** But constantly criticising mostly uncles/aunties on a forum full of youths that will band together to circle-jerk with you over these ""backward"" people is similarly fucking narrow-minded and similarly shows a lack of empathy, because you're just judging them without stopping to think if there's a reason behind their behaviours. You're just judging them based on your own experiences and upbringing and just ""assuming"" they're selfish/stupid by nature.

gnsbzk,1590046142,gnsbzk,100,,"**INTRODUCTION**

Last week, I had read with deep concern about an NTU student’s difficulties in seeking redress from SPH over a fabricated interview regarding his COVID-19 experience.

I am also a victim of false/misleading articles and headlines published by SPH. This relates to a road traffic accident in 2014 caused by a taxi driver, from which I suffered injuries. The accident happened on the first day of my new job, and I was placed on several weeks of medical and hospitalisation leave. A few months later, I lost my job. I had only recently resolved the claim lawsuit with the taxi’s insurer after 6 long years. SPH published several articles about my lawsuit in September and November 2019. The Independent Singapore had earlier reported on my incident: http://theindependent.sg/sph-articles-triggered-online-harassment-and-death-threats-for-victim-of-road-traffic-accident/.

I am choosing to speak out now to **stand in solidarity** with the NTU student and many others who have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of irresponsible reporting by the media.

**SPH’S FALSE/MISLEADING HEADLINES AND ARTICLES**

In my case, the SPH’s headlines and articles published on 10 September 2019 and 15 November 2019 were false/misleading in 3 key respects.

First, the claim was disputed only against the taxi’s insurer, and not fought with the taxi driver even though he was technically named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The insurance company contested my claim rigorously at every stage of the lawsuit - it was a battle of David and Goliath for me going up against a corporate giant. The taxi driver, who was found by the trial judge to be 100% to blame for causing the accident, did not have to compensate me personally in any way and I most definitely did not demand him to make the compensation, as suggested by SPH’s headlines/captions (Lianhe Wanbao: [今日强打] “女律师…要求德士司机赔偿…医药费和收入损失”; Straits Times (ST): “Lawyer seeks … damages from cabby”).

He was not made to “bear 100% responsibility” (Zaobao/Shin Min Daily News: “德士司机要为这起意外承担100%责任”, “德士司机需负全责…赔偿数额…待高挺审判“，“德士的辩护律师尝试要降低赔偿额”), nor was he sued “tragically” out of pocket (Zaobao/Shin Min Daily News: “德士叔 赔惨了”), as suggested by SPH’s reports.

Singapore’s compulsory motor insurance scheme was enacted precisely to ensure that victims of road traffic accidents would receive compensation, and their recovery is not dependent on the financial means of the errant driver.

Second, the ST article reported that “A lawyer…is seeking a record .. damages for disruption to her career progression”. **This is false.** The Lianhe Zaobao/Shin Min Daily News caption/article went further to state that “she claimed her injuries adversely impacted her career and promotion prospects, therefore she sued the cabby” (“她称伤势影响她的前途和升职机会, 因此起诉德士司机…”). This is **patently false.**

Nowhere in my pleadings or evidence did I make any claim for loss of career or promotion prospects. Such a **false narrative** paints me in an unfavourable light, and indeed, many netizens were misled to comment that I was delusional and greedy in making a claim for promotions which are not guaranteed.

Third, SPH, through its printed and online news, had insinuated that I was seeking compensation from a taxi driver for a “record breaking” sum. This is likewise **misleading**. SPH had failed to mention that an injured cyclist in a previous case had submitted a claim of about 4 times higher and was awarded a sum higher than my claim amount. ST senior reporter “K” who reported about my accident claim had himself reported on that case back in 2016.

The issue of SPH’s misleading headlines is made worse as many of the online articles were set to “premium”, which means that many internet readers will not be able to read beyond its headlines. In my opinion, this **misleading narrative** is not only **irresponsible**, but also **potentially dangerous** as it could stoke public sentiments against lawyers seemingly bullying the lower income workers in our community, as was in fact borne out by the comments left on the Facebook posts of the various SPH online articles.

Consequently, many readers went away with the wrong impression that I was heartlessly seeking an unmeritorious exorbitant sum of compensation from the taxi driver personally, and for mere disruption to my career at that. As a direct result of the misleading SPH reports, I became the target of **doxxing, cyber bullying** in the form of vitriolic attacks, threats and insults laced with violence and vulgarity from online commentators. On 18 November 2019, I was even sent a **hate mail** with veiled threat from an agitated member of the public. The email was copied to my ex-employer, Senior Minister of State for Law and Health and the president of the Law Society of Singapore to further embarrass me. Fearing for my safety, I was advised to file a police report.

**SPH’S PUBLICATIONS AGAINST MY CONSENT**

Not only were SPH’s publications misleading in their reporting of my accident claims, they were also published without my consent.

In September 2019, about 2 weeks before the assessment trial, while I was frantically preparing for trial, ST senior reporter “K” had reached out to ask for the court papers and an interview. Through my claims lawyer, I **declined and requested for my privacy to be respected**. We also communicated our concerns that any publicity at that time might jeopardise the settlement negotiations with the insurance company and offered instead an exclusive interview at a later stage. Despite our pleas, ST went ahead to publish an article about my case on 10 September 2019, **identifying me by name, disclosing my age, detailing my employment details and injuries.** That same morning, a couple of reporters from the SPH Chinese papers took turns to show up at my office and one even **trespassed into my private residential estate** and knocked on my front door! I had to call the security guard to remove the trespasser. That evening, both SPH’s Chinese papers, Lianhe Wanbao and Shin Min Daily News, carried a “breaking news” story about my case on their front page, with the former **splashing my photograph prominently on its front page.** The SPH English and Chinese articles were also published on SPH’s websites and social media platforms.

Later on 13 November 2019, ST senior reporter “K” approached my claims lawyer again enquiring on the status of the case and seeking comments/interview. I had by then resolved the lawsuit with the insurance company through a confidential mediated settlement. Through my claims lawyer, I communicated my distress and concerns regarding the false and misleading statements in the earlier reports, and **again requested for my privacy to be respected.**

On the same day, I reached out to the head of SPH Chinese Media Group to **communicate my distress and concerns** about the previous articles. Through her, a meeting was set up with ST news editor to discuss possible corrective actions. However, ST published the second article on 15 November 2019, in the morning just before the scheduled afternoon meeting.

The second ST article reproduced largely the same contents including my name, age, employment details and injuries, and this time **publishing my photograph and splashing it on its Facebook post.**

**PUBLIC INTEREST FOR SPH TO ISSUE CLARIFICATION**

I had since issued a legal letter in December 2019 to SPH seeking clarification and take-down of the online articles. SPH had refused to accede to any of my requests, and its curt denial of responsibility has been most disappointing.

**(A) Professional Responsibility**

Legalities aside, one would have thought that SPH would do the right and responsible thing. They should offer immediate remedial actions upon learning of the harassment and threats visited upon me following the widespread public misperception caused by their articles. **Surely, the priority is to minimise further harm to me? How difficult is it to issue a correction or clarification?** Instead, the SPH’s reporters and editors have chosen to hide behind their legal team to categorically deny all responsibility.

I am encouraged by the editor of SPH Chinese Media Group, Ms. Han Yong May’s recent public assurance that the SPH newsroom management has a code of conduct and expects its employees to adhere to journalistic principles and processes. I hope that by bringing this matter to light, SPH will conduct a proper review and investigation, and provide an empathetic and considered response to my concerns instead of issuing a bare denial. **Misleading news reporting, not to mention reporters’ conduct of unauthorised publication and trespassing, should not be tolerated.** I earnestly hope that SPH will do the responsible thing to set an example for the rest of the industry.

**(B) Fair and Accurate Reporting**

By sharing my story, I want to make sure that the truth can be put out there so those who read the original articles have a countervailing version of what really transpired. At the same time, I hope to **inform the public about the process of accident claim.**

Indeed, if SPH was reporting with public interest in mind, **why was the taxi company or insurance company not named in any of the published articles?** Surely, the public would benefit from being informed about the safety record of taxi companies, the compulsory motor insurance scheme or what to do in an accident claim process. Most importantly, the public should be assured that the victim of a traffic accident would receive compensation from the insurance company whatever the financial means of the errant driver.

**(C) Standing Up For Citizen’s Privacy &amp; Social Justice**

By refusing to acknowledge any shortcomings or to engage with a private citizen deeply aggrieved by their actions and articles, SPH has missed an opportunity to restore public trust in traditional news media and to lead the industry on the best way forward to combat “fake news” in this internet age, even as our authorities warn of the dangers of falsehoods **damaging livelihoods and reputation** overnight and insidiously **undermining social cohesion.**

Through my speaking up in this case, it is my hope that **future accident victims and insurance claimants will not be deterred from pursuing legal remedy** for fear of repercussions arising from unwanted adverse publicity.

My case shows that what is worse than doxxing by individual netizens is **doxxing by reporters** with the power and reach of the mass media behind them. POHA was enacted precisely for the purpose of **protecting the privacy of private individuals,** even those who are legally or morally culpable. What more, then, for victims who need the space and time to recover from their injuries and ordeals. Why should they be made to **suffer twice over because of irresponsible media coverage?**

COVID-19 has heightened our senses to injustices and inequality within our community. Will we call out those who rest on the laurel of their corporate strength and **speak up for the victims?** Or will we continue to keep our heads down and look the other way in the face of injustice, however big or small?

&gt;BEN LEONG·MONDAY, JULY 6, 2020·READING TIME: 4 MINUTES

&gt;Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herewith are strictly mine as a private citizen and has nothing to do with my employer, the National University of Singapore.

&gt;Allow me to say that I am both infuriated and deeply distressed that this GE has become a circus.

&gt;We are staring into the looming crisis of the century and yet we have allowed the GE to be hijacked by frivolous issues like Ivangate, 10m population, NCMP, handling of COVID19, POFMA, and now Raeesahgate. 

&gt;Not saying that the handling of COVID19 is not important, but we just go and convene a COI after the public health crisis is over can or not? *sigh* Like it or not, the biggest fallout from COVID19 for this country is no longer the public health crisis (that is more or less under control). The looming problem is the economic fallout. 

&gt;Allow me to also highlight (and I am not trying to defend the Government here) that even if the Government did mishandle the COVID19 healthcare situation, it does not thereby mean that the Government is no good with the economics. Conversely, even if we had maintained “good standard” in COVID19 crisis management, it doesn’t thereby naturally follow that the Government has the answers to the economic problem. For now, can we just focus on the latter?

&gt;I had no idea who Raeesah Khan was until this latest fiasco, but given what I have read, I am deeply concerned about the potential rise of AOC-style politics in Singapore. Dunno what is AOC? Google is your friend. That's not diversity. That's called polarization.

&gt;I agree with Calvin that we need to reject importing stupid Western highfalutin ideas into this country. Simi sai ""brown face""?

&gt;I had expressed earlier that Ivan Lim was an untenable candidate for the PAP. I reserve the same assessment for Raeesah Khan. I call upon my fellow Singaporeans in Sengkang GRC to send WP packing, to send WP a strong signal that as a country, we reject AOC-style polarization in our political system. For now, can we please just let the Police handle the case and move on?

&gt;We have Polling Day coming up in 4 days. Can we all please focus on the impending train wreck that our economy is currently running headlong into.

&gt;PAP wants a strong mandate. Can the PAP please explain to the population why we should believe that PAP's plan will be able to keep us safe and allow us to survive the upcoming economic apocalypse?

&gt;The Opposition wants to be a check and balance? Fair, but deny &gt;
super-majority my foot! How does that help anything at all? It probably about time you demonstrate to us that you actually have the capability to actually be a check and balance? 

&gt;The Opposition wants to argue that minimum wage is the best thing since sliced bread for Singapore? Fine! Then perhaps start explain and argue your case to the common people? Then the PAP can respond. 

&gt;The Government should use this time to explain its policies so that the population can support them. Yes, we have heard all these wonderful things that we will do with the $100 bn, but why are they the right things? Why are the suggestions by the Opposition not better? 

&gt;Our people are really not stupid one. You explain to them properly, I believe that they can understand. 

&gt;Allow me to also highlight to the PAP that the items in the Opposition manifestos are not policy innovations. They are a collection of grievances. Many people are unhappy. The Opposition has so kindly collected the whole set for you. Maybe this GE is a good time to make at least some feeble attempts to address them? 

&gt;You want a strong mandate. People have existing grievances and you ignore them, and you expect them to give you a strong mandate. I only have one word to describe this situation: /facepalm. 

&gt;And by the way, this kaypoh here can also write a better manifesto than all of of the Opposition parties put together (WP probably only covered 95% of the grievances) -- if people will just write him a blank cheque. 

&gt;What I am saying is that the opposition should explain to us just how the heck you are planning to pay for all the goodies in your manifestos. Currently, you not only do not tell us how you are going to pay for the stuff, you also want to suspend GST. 

&gt;Is this how we can expect you to check on the Government? Don’t want the PAP to have a blank cheque, but you happily issue yourselves a blank check? Must have learnt this “ownself check ownself” from the PAP? No wonder “PAP-lite.”

&gt;We have 4 more days to Polling Day. We really need to get our sh*t together and do that *now*. 

&gt;Or we better stay praying.",,"Ben Leong on Raeesah, PAP-Lite etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hm2eyy/ben_leong_on_raeesah_paplite_etc/
iotg26,1599571313,iotg26,100,," I have noticed an uptick in posts and comments about people feeling stressed looking for work or under stress in their respective workplaces and thought it would be good to create this post. I am not a psychologist or a counselor, but I figured if I could make someone feel better, this effort would have been worthwhile. Feel free to share your own story or words of encouragement too!

**TO YOU** who are currently looking for work, not hearing back from anyone despite sending out tens and hundreds of applications.

**TO YOU** who are repeatedly checking your inboxes and phones for a hint of an acknowledgement or response from a headhunter.

**TO YOU** who have gone for interviews but have not heard anything from the company.

**TO YOU** who drag your feet to your laptop every morning because you dread opening your inbox and seeing the torrent of emails coming in.

**TO YOU** who panic when your phone rings or vibrates because you know it's your boss with more nasty messages.

**TO YOU** feeling anxious in the office, taking seemingly forever to do the simplest tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say

**Hang in there! You are doing great!**

Many people around you also have their own struggles and failures. I am not saying this to belittle or invalidate your feelings, but I want you to know that you are not alone in this fight. We are all in this together. It is not just the recession that is affecting us, the pandemic has forced us to distance ourselves from each other. And those of us who normally rely on social interaction or even simply companionship, this support has been stripped away. But the very fact that you are reading this, means that you are choosing not to give up. It is the opposite! You are saying, ""I am fighting my hardest, and looking to stay afloat! Give me something to hang on to!"". That is something to be proud of.

**Be kind to yourself.**

Some of us might be wondering if we should quit our jobs if we are under so much stress but hold back because of how bad the market is out there. The truth is, both options are not easy choices, especially for those of you with families to feed or parents to take care of. If you are not feeling motivated for work, see if you can step away for a moment and take some time to yourself. If possible, step out of the house or office and get some fresh air. Don't take this journey as a sprint; it is a marathon and no one is in tip top condition right now.

**Reach out and ask for help.**

If you have friends nearby (or if you trust your colleagues), reach out for a coffee chat and share your struggles. You may be surprised that they have some problems of their own too. Sometimes the act of narrating your story helps you gain perspective, and the being able to speak out aids in recovery. If you are not comfortable talking to your friends or family, I welcome you to share your own story below - we are all in this together!

**Take baby steps**

For most of us, there is unlikely a quick fix that is around the corner. This means we will need to manage our own issues and learn to deal with it. It is daunting to see the mountain of what we are trying to achieve, but no one built Rome in a day. Take each day at a time, and break down each day into manageable chunks. You can focus on work for 1 hour and give yourself a 10 minute break to reward yourself. If you are looking for work, maybe treat yourself to a nice movie after having done 10 applications.

**Remember**

We are all in this together, and there will always be a listening ear. We are all merely ants in this grand stage of life.

javont,1602658117,javont,101,,"In the recent Aug 2020 BTO sales launch, I decided to apply for a 2 Room BTO as a single. I am detailing the process here in hope of helping other similar first timers trying to apply for a BTO flat. I thought a guide would be useful. Some of these may look like common sense but bear with me la.

**Before applying, things to take note:**

* Check on your eligibility to apply via the \[HDB\] ([https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/buying-process/application-procedure](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/buying-process/application-procedure)) website. The whole application process is outlined in the site. But there were still a few times I wished I had more guidance on the process. Single Citizen Scheme is only applicable for 2 room BTO in non mature estates. 
* First timer singles applying for BTO flats need to pay $15K in addition to the flat price. The flat price  may also be much higher than what is stated during the sales launch by anything from 10-50K depending on the unit your choose. Higher floors come at a premium, corner flats come at a premium, unblocked flats come at a premium and ofc bigger flats (47sqm vs 39sqm) cost about 20K more than the smaller ones which I feel is a bit wasteful for a hallway. But I'm quite giam siap lah lol. When you add 15K to it, that's quite a huge difference from the advertised sales launch price. That kind of price usually is for the low level (Eg level 4) 39 square metre flats that are blocked &amp; corridor unit. Do your homework and work out your finances (what kind of loan, if any, you need) before you start applying to save a lot of grief. Of course there is the EHG grant but if you're earning a decent salary it's probably just a meagre figure that won't help much. The grants for family nucleus is much more attractive for obvious reasons.
* Keep your old pay slips. You need the past 12 months pay slips or income \[letter\]([https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/income-guidelines-and-other-documents](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/income-guidelines-and-other-documents)), also your CPF contribution history and previous year CPF Yearly Statement, but these can be obtained online.
* I repeat again, do your homework. At first I had this stupid mentality that everything will work out on its own but that's not gonna do you any favours. This is a major purchase. Choose your flat before  the appointment, work out your finances, keep your documents, *apply early* and you won't have as many nasty surprises/disappointments.

1. BTO Sales is launched. You are given one week to apply for the flat. I recommend applying as soon as you can because I think the ballot number is based on order of application.   
At this point you should start preparing your HDB Housing Loan Eligibility letter (HLE) from HDB, or Approval in Principle (AIP) from the bank, whichever institution you decide  to loan from. I can't advise on this because I'm using neither. I don't like borrowing money heh.
2. Wait for results. After about two weeks, the ballot results will be out. If you sign up for the SMS alert they may or may not alert you via SMS (Or be late about it). You can check the HDB portal periodically for the status, or if you check daily thread people will usually post about their ballot number being too high/quite small. Apparently this is like tioing TOTO. My first time round applying it was Sales of balance flats and I failed to get any number. This time my ballot number was three digits, a little bigger than the number of flats available, so I'm quite lucky I guess. Even if your number is like 20 more than the ballot number, you might still have a chance because the numbers before your might cancel their application.   
 This is where I got a little confused. I excitedly went into the HDB portal, clicked on my ballot number and there was a button for open booking of flats. It stated that *""there are no available flats left for singles left"".*  So of course I thought I no longer had a chance in booking a flat but...
3. You receive an invitation to book your flat. Mucho confusion. I thought no more flats for singles left?  During the days up to the appointment date so many wild thoughts were running through my mind because of the earlier message. But I decided to chalk it up as a glitch in the system and went ahead and prepared the documents. Even now, after I have booked my flat I still have this innate fear that it wouldn't  be approved because of this.   
  You have to download the application form, annexes, HLE or AIP, required documents, \[EHG application form\] ([https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/-/media/doc/EAPG/ehg-form.pdf](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/-/media/doc/EAPG/ehg-form.pdf)), Appointment letter (You need this for gaining access to HDB sales office during Covid period. I'm not sure about before or after Covid). Just print out everything la better be safe than sorry.  This is where your pay slips for past 12 months come into play cos  you need them for grant application. Try to clear your date and time for the appointment because you can't change it. Alternatively, you can ask somebody else to go in your stead but why would you entrust that to someone else, unless it's your SO or someone with a good grasp on what you want.   
   My SIL and bro drove me to the site before the appointment date so that I could make an informed choice on which is the ideal unit among those left. I highly recommend visiting the site before your appointment. Study the site map and unit placements to choose your unit. As my ballot number was greater than the available flats, the good units (no blocked view, corner unit, higher floor) were all taken liao so left with some that had shortcomings, but what to do. I didn't want to waste my chance.
4. Go for your appointment. And bring all those documents your printed.  Check and double check the night before. I put mine in a folder. Do not be late for your appointment lest your flat choice be potong jalaned by someone else. If you miss the appointment time they'll give your slot to the next person in the ballot queue.  Then you gg might have to wait until 12noon or something.
5. The HDB officer will process your documents and ask you to sign a bunch of stuff, explain your flat price, assorted legal fees and your financing options. You'll have to pay an option fee of $500, which will be refunded when you make the down payment. During this process my heart was pounding and I almost teared up because it is a poignant moment when I'm making one of the major decisions in my life.   
  Your grant application will be approved in one to two month's time and the appointment to sign the lease agreement about two or three months time.

Aaaand this is where I'm at right now,  waiting for the results with mixed feelings. Did I make the right decision? Too late, I've already done the deed. So now I have about two years, give or take, to plan and save for my renovation and furniture.

Thus I’ve decided to share this edited version of what I originally wrote as a comment reply to a comment in today’s daily thread.

May it helpful for those of us who need to hear this. 💗🙆🏻‍♀️💗

While you’ve decided to end it all, just postponing it slightly won’t make much of a difference, since if either way you do it you’ll be equally dead, so why not give yourself one last happy moment.

Going on a trip is good cos it takes you out of your current situation and during the trip you may be able to see your usual day-to-day life from outside of it which allows you to view it more objectively. 

Since an overseas trip right now (or anytime soon) is out of the question, try a staycation or whatever you can think of that will be able to take you out of your daily life at least for a couple of days. 

Oftentimes when people do that, they realise that their lives are actually not that bad after all and still worth living and holding on to hope that things may get better soon.

Taking a vacation/staycation or just taking time to do something you truly enjoy( e.g. going to the park or nature reserve, a day at a nice cafe, treating yourself to a nice restaurant meal) also allows you to be taken out of your daily grind to treat yourself and do something you enjoy. Plus getting to see the world outside your daily seemingly hopeless and helpless situation. 

With that, you may then realise that there are still things you wanna do in life and places you wanna see and people you wanna meet after all and ending your life right now will take away all opportunities to do these things. Why not return and start doing these things now in your life so that you’ll be without regrets or what-ifs.

If there isn’t any such way you can think of, if you have a private Shield plan with rider, check with your insurer if they cover inpatient psychiatric treatment. I only know that Prudential does. If so, head down to IMH and tell them you are suicidal and want to self-admit to the Sayang Wellness ward (IMH’s private ward). 

You’ll be able to start yourself on psychological and psychiatric treatment as well as go stay in a conducive environment, and the ward has really nice and caring nurses plus food is also not bad. 

If finances are an issue but this idea sounds good to you, same thing, head down to IMH and ask to be self-admitted to the MDU ward (Mood Disorders Unit). It’s a subsidised ward, but they designed it to have less of a hospital feel and more like a dorm (?), with a large common area where everyone hangs around together for meals, group therapy and activities, play board games or watch TV during free time etc. 

You can also upgrade your food to A class (they’ll charge a few bucks as a top-up per meal, back then it was $7 iirc) cos the subsidised IMH food is pretty terrible. (unless they’ve since changed it, hopefully!)

Just see it as a staycation, not a hospital admission, and as a brief respite out of whatever situation you’re facing in your daily life.

Hope this was helpful! ❤️

I say all of the above as someone who benefited from a spontaneous trip I took when I was suicidal (following after advice I had found on a website for the suicidal; I won’t share the link here cos said website also contains explanations about various methods of suicide which may not be the best for thread-OP to read now).

I’m a two-time suicide survivor (2014 &amp; 2015), and when I was suicidal the third time back in 2017, I had found this advice and decided to put it into practice since I had nothing to lose anyway if I was really gonna off myself.

So I spontaneously gave myself my first birthday trip which was also my first solo trip, for my 31st birthday. I wouldn’t suggest to empty all your savings to do it so as to give yourself money to fall back on. I just spent money I could afford but had thus far seen as being wasteful if I were to go by myself.

What was affordable to me then (flying budget, staying in hostels, eating cheap) would be a tight budget for anyone else as I had by then exhausted all my savings on medical bills in trying to treat my chronic illness or at least bring it to a manageable level so I could restart my life again after everything was gradually halted with the diagnosis between age 27-28.

But I did splurge on paragliding (cheaper version of skydiving that’s on my bucket list; if iFly @ Sentosa is open already it’s a good alternative; I’ve also tried it before, loved it and would gladly do it again) and it was fun! 

Flying/sleeping/eating budget also did not make the trip any less good. Going solo also allowed me to travel at my own pace, doing only what I want instead of my lifelong ways of pleasing others.

And doing all of that really help bring me out of the pit of depression and I didn’t wanna end my life anymore, cos I still wanna take more trips like that. 

It also helped me to realise that putting myself first and “acting selfishly without regard for others” (what my parents said) in the end didn’t cause any trouble to anyone and overall only produced positive results so putting myself first isn’t really bad at all and I could also start to do it in my everyday life bit by bit. (But not to the point of being selfish or self-entitled of course.)

I do sincerely hope and pray my little sharing will help someone in some way. If you would like a listening ear, feel free to DM me anytime. Doesn’t have to be now, whenever you wanna talk. Even if it’s weeks after this post.

gofcww,1590135524,gofcww,110,,"I am writing this as a current Social Work student, and this piece is wholly my opinion. This also serves as a discussion piece for those of you interested in this topic to leave any relevant comments, and I will try my best to engage constructively. I will not provide a TL;DR version as it is best to read this in full if you want to fully understand what I am trying to say.

For those of you familiar with Social Work, one of the core values of the Social Work profession, as defined in the Code of Professional Ethics, is Social Justice. Advocacy and activism is also defined as key concepts in Social Work to achieve social justice and people empowerment. However, in Singapore’s context, and especially among peers and educators in the Social Work field, I feel that activism/advocacy has always been the elephant in the room. While many Social Workers here can empathise with the plights of those who actively seek to invoke change through advocacy/activism, very few are inclined to trod down the same path, as such actions are often seen as taboo or socially unacceptable, and often does not bode well in terms of career prospects.

Both advocacy and activism against the current status quo have always been actively discouraged in Singapore’s context, and some activists like Jolovan Wham and Kirsten Han sometimes run afoul of the law while trying to promote certain social changes. Other activists/advocates might not run afoul of the law, but are still often vilified by mainstream media or pro-incumbent commentators as agitators working against national interests, or simply just do-gooders with scant regard of national unity in times of crises. This is especially eminent in the context of COVID-19, where migrant workers rights have been extensively discussed. However, this can also refer to long-standing activism in other areas, including LGBT rights and free speech advocates (most notably those against POFMA)

I’m writing this piece because I have grown increasingly frustrated with the narrative that social activist/advocates are people who are ungrateful and who choose to only focus on the negatives. It is akin to saying healthcare workers are pessimists for monitoring and focusing on the debilitating symptoms of patients. Social Workers exist to bring about changes in marginalised sectors in the community to the best of their abilities. It is their job to identify discriminatory or negative traits of society and to bring them to light in order to remedy them. It is blatant disrespect to assume that activism (i.e. civil disobedience etc) is their first course of action when it is very likely to be their last resort, after negotiation and communications with relevant authorities have failed over a period of time.

However, my quip is not solely with people who oppose any change to the status quo with all their vehement fervour, or who openly deride such activists/advocates.

Certain people who are conservative in some religious groups will always be against LGBT rights. Certain people with business and political interests will always cite the trade-offs between migrant worker safety and economic viability, and if forced to choose one, will choose one. Certain people (and governments!) who value a paternalistic stance on collective security will never view free speech in a positive light.

What really irks me is how the seemingly average and moderate Singaporean remains critical of activism and advocacy, despite them being sympathetic to the various causes. In my many conversations with friends and family (or even strangers online) regarding said topics, they invariably follow the same vein of thought. 

“Oh I support LGBT rights, I just don’t think they should make such a huge fuss about 377A because it’s not enforced, and besides we just need to wait until society is less conservative and more ready. No point for conflict now and no point to go protest at Pink Dot.”

“Oh I absolutely agree that there should transparency and accountability in migrant worker issues. We definitely need to do more for them. It’s just that this is not the right time to discuss it when everyone is busy working on it and since it’s such a huge national crisis we cannot be divisive. Maybe when this is all over we can come back and relook this topic.”

“Oh yeah I don’t think POFMA is a good idea. But I think people should just follow and not challenge it at all. If there’s anything wrong they can just go to the courts or appeal against it, and time will tell if they are right”

“Oh yeah our nurses are being paid quite lowly and some of them are angry that they are valued less than swabbers, but we need swabbers urgently, so let’s just talk about nurse wages another time and focus at the thing at hand.”

Realise the one thing in common? It’s always about waiting for the right time, for the right environment, but no one can put it at a definitive date, and we are all expected to just go along with it.

I understand Singapore cannot change overnight. We cannot suddenly become kinder, less racially divisive, and less discriminatory of certain minority groups. But we cannot continue to be enablers of injustices as well, however passive that might be, however socially convenient it might be to do so. 

In Martin Luther King’s words, justice delayed is justice denied. I leave an excerpt of his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, in which he addressed white moderates who seemingly agree with his aims, but not his actions. I feel this is especially relevant in virtually all struggles minorities and persecuted members of societies face today, and not just in Singapore.

(“First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”)

I will admit, I myself have been a passive enabler on many occasions, choosing to be civil and going with the flow rather than proactively seeking change. But as I look at protests and civil disobediences throughout the world, something frightens me as a prospective Social Worker. I look at how police brutality is rampant in Hong Kong protests, and yet there are people clamouring for peace and for protestors to just pack it up for the sake of economic stability. I look at how students with no political or protest experiences are thrusted into the fray overnight, for simply standing up to the values they believe in and have been taught their entire lives. I look at how ordinary citizens are arrested and beaten up, simply for refusing to give up their hard earned right to protest against what they perceive to be an unjust system.

While I am thankful that there is no basis for such violence and malignancy in Singapore, there remains a small part of my conscience nibbling at me. What if one day, the Singapore I fight for is no longer the Singapore I know? What if one day, as a Social Worker, one of the causes I am so passionate in becomes taboo to speak about? Do I remain civil and back down? Or is there something in this world worth fighting for, and worth standing up for, even if the consequences placed upon me by the state or authorities would be severe? Would I have to dissent according to my best and most genuine intentions or should I reluctantly acquiesce for the sake of civility, and become the very same “moderate” that enabled the injustice I had worked so hard to prevent all these years?

Already, dissent is strongly frowned upon here. I read with great disappointment that the simple act of holding a cardboard with a smiley face can be considered a violation of the Public Order Act and is liable for police investigation. 

You might say, it’s his problem for choosing to support climate justice activists, for not following the law against public assembly, for doing it despite being already placed in the public spotlight.

But think about it, what if one day the thing you so strongly believes in becomes a criminal offence, or something socially unacceptable? What if you have to forgo your dignity to the profession and calling you undertook or the values that have defined you as an unique human being?

The people on the right side today are often on the wrong side in history. Change often comes at the expense of the status quo. Let’s be kinder and less critical of people who spend their lives fighting what they perceive to be an unjust system. I am not saying you should join and support them at all costs, but at the very least, understand where they are coming from.

il440o,1599041547,il440o,110,,"I took some time to think about the entire debate of foreigner vs. Singaporean and wanted to look at it from the other side. 

Maybe employers are right and there **really** is a lack of Singaporeans to fill all these roles. Here is some evidence to suggest so: If we have more skilled workers than positions available (because these positions are being taken away by foreigners), then the over-supply of Singaporean graduates in that sector must cause them to be lowly paid and unemployed. But this does not seem to be the case for the two sectors in Singapore that have been under scrutiny: finance and IT. 

**The full-time employment rate for NUS computing grads is at 90%, with a 5k median salary. It is at a full 100% for business analytics, and a 82.6% for Biz admin.** These are extremely high numbers if you compare them to Arts, Science and Engineering courses. In fact, the numbers are way above the average employment rates and median salaries of fresh grads in Singapore and are only behind Law/Med. This is similar across the other local universities too. How could it be that in these sectors, jobs are going to foreigners, but at the same time, skilled Singaporeans in these sectors are paid high and are fully employed? 

Indeed, if there were not enough jobs available in these sectors because of foreigners, we would see lower employment rates and salaries for these graduates as competition for jobs heats up.

But maybe the problem of middle-aged PMETs instead of fresh grads. On this part, I only have anecdotal evidence. Anyone who has ever worked in a big organisation in Singapore or even just been in the SAF during NS will know what this group of boomers are like. Many of them are the type who are not very productive. Just imagine the DXO aunties who come in at 9am and go buy breakfast, chit chat and come back at 11 to start ""work"". In the end, the only ""work"" they do is politicking in the office and trying to defend their little fiefdoms/departments by siam-ing work to others and those below them. 

Personally, I had one experience where a manager left on maternity leave, and her work was being picked up by the juniors under her watch, who were all interns or contracts. In the end, we wondered why she was paid her salary if we could run so smoothly without her. Anecdotally, a friend in another department has a middle-aged colleague who literally stopped doing work ever since circuit breaker started and everyone WFH. But the boss cant even be bothered to fire or reprimand. 

Many of them have this huge ego, and only want managerial jobs where they are making people do work rather than doing the work themselves. In today's age of flat hierarchies like Google and Facebook, how many of such jobs are even available? Everyone needs technical knowledge these days, and their resistance to upskill will hurt their job prospects quite a bit. 

Of course, all this is anecdotal. I'm sure there are cases where Singaporeans are being passed up the chance to be hired or promoted because they are discriminated. But is this true in all instances?

Overall, I do think that these companies could still give more opportunities to Singaporeans, given that they benefit a lot from Singapore's safety and infrastructure. But at the same time, I wonder if they are getting all the talent that they actually need...

Hi all,

I've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so.

I returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS.

October 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my rite of passage from an ""Ah Boy"" to a ""Man"". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly the worst cough and thought to myself;

""You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior""

Despite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on.

As weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough (it had started getting better by itself prior to that so didn’t see the urgency). I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91. I mention these IPPT scores not to show off but to show you how unexpected a sickness may arrive, even when you think you are in the pink of health.

Mid-November: I notice a lump in my neck!

While having swimming lessons at HTA, which by the way, honestly is a beautiful camp, I felt slight discomfort while doing different types of strokes. I felt my neck and realised there was a large lump. I didn't think much of it, and assumed it was my lymph nodes swelling up because of my cough. A few days after that discovery, the antibiotics and cough syrup I received started to wear off and my cough came back in full force. I went to the MO once again, but this time mentioned my inflated Lymph Nodes. I was given another round of antibiotics and was told; if the lymph nodes don't swell down come back.

A Christmas surprise: My lymph nodes never decreased in size.

We were lucky enough to receive a few days Block leave to celebrate Christmas and the New Year's. I quickly flew back to KL to see my friends and family. Despite having an amazing time there, the fact that my lymph nodes kept increasing in size was keeping me from fully enjoying myself. My flight back to SG was on a Sunday morning and I had to report back to camp by Sunday evening. As soon as I landed, I went to the nearest clinic right before closing time. The doctor took down my symptoms and told me he suspected there was a slight chance this might be Tuberculosis which itself carries a 6 month treatment plan. He gave me a few days MC and referred me to Polyclinic to get an x-ray. By the way, big-ups to the Singapore Public health care system; it's truly out of this world. Anyways, the x-ray came back inconclusive so, I was sent to Changi General Hospital for an MRI on the 31st of December and this is where things took a turn towards the dark. The doctor came back with the results and mentioned it might be tuberculosis, or it might be a cancer of the lymph nodes. My face went pale, and immediately felt the need to cry. We were not sure of it yet, so I told myself; I'm 18, fit and healthy. There is no way in hell I have cancer. To confirm doctor's suspicions, I was sent to SGH where I met, in my opinion the world's best oncologist. There, they suggested I did a biopsy (small procedure on my neck to remove a lymph node) and a PET-Scan (heavily prevalent scan to detect cancer growth over time).

January 10th brought my life's most devastating news yet: I was alone. I went to see my Oncologist to get my results. My parents had important things to attend to overseas and were instead with me on the phone during the meeting. My doctor asked my parents to fly down and I assumed the worst. She wanted my parents to be here with my while she announces the news but I couldn't handle the wait and asked her bluntly; did I have cancer, yes or no. She nodded sympathetically, and my whole life flashed before my eyes. I felt like breaking down. I cannot find words intense enough to describe the absolutely horrid feeling of someone informing you that you are cancer ridden, let alone at the young age of 18. When my parents arrived, I was given the full diagnosis. Stage 4A Nodular Sclerosis Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The cancer had spread to to my neck, my lungs, my spine and the bone on my ass. I thought I must've had a small beginner cancer at first since I didn't feel any worse than usual except for incessant itching and night sweats, but nope, I was given the creme de la creme of bad diagnoses.

The following days went by quickly, I accepted my situation and was ready to tackle cancer. Before I knew it, I found myself in a hospital bed receiving chemotherapy. The most unexpected, emotionally and physically painful experience I've endured. There were multiple complications which landed me around 1.5 months in hospital, sleepless nights, losing sight of what feeling normal felt like and just feeling content with not being in excruciating pain. And the stress with COVID as well! Either way, I went through my 12 rounds of chemotherapy as best as I could with the amazing support of my parents taking care of me, solely moving back to Singapore to be with me. I tried to live my life as normal as I could and realised that was foolish and to instead, take things at my new pace of life.

It is now September, 9 months post my diagnosis and 2.5 months post my last chemotherapy. You truly don't appreciate life until it might be taken away from you. As cheesy as it sounds, it's true. I was given a second chance at life and never take a day for granted. Each day brings it's own beautiful wonders and sometimes hardships. Just be thankful we are all alive and love the people around you as they are the ones who come forward in your time of need. Many lessons were learnt during my treatment and although I am not grateful for having had cancer, I appreciate much more who I am now than who I was before cancer.

Thank you to the amazing doctors and nurses at SGH and everyone at SPF who was involved with my case and the MO at HTA. The Singaporean community really is the most giving and caring although it might not always seem like it.

If you made it all the way down here, thank you for reading. Writing this brought back the first tears since the end of chemotherapy :')

Love,

Jules.

The seemingly contractionary stance of many of the measures they have created lot's of frustration as the lack of sociiazlation has taken a large mental toll on all. of us that is going unacknowledged by the government more interested in propping up the economy.

Furthermore the perception that this is a safe election for the PAP might encourage many Singaporeans to vote opposition as protests vote and the lack of LHL might cause the party to lose some of the familiarity so essenital to it's political success. 

I'm going to make a caution prediction that while the PAP will still be returned to goverment their vote share will probably fall and the oppostion might actually gain some seats which probably be a disaster for the groomed 4th generation leadership. .https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/general-elections-singapore-heng-swee-keat-covid19-12775996",,Will the Early Election Plan Backfire on the PAP Fourth-Generation Leadership?,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gx2wrb/will_the_early_election_plan_backfire_on_the_pap/

Sub-prime crisis.  Was it true that no one saw it coming?
Were there not people who tried to raise the alarm?

Wirecard - Where was the money?  People raised questions and were silenced.

Dormitories - Real NGOs (TCW2, HOME) have been saying for years that the situation is a disaster waiting to happen.  What did the official NGO MWC do?  Nothing.

SMRT - Trains kept breaking down, LTA kept quiet, CEO says we're not at ""crush loads"" - what happened?

And yes, I am going to argue that we could have seen it coming.  Because there were people raising alarm, but all these were brushed aside by those in power.

So here in SG, this is our situation - 
1. Our Prime Minister is Chairman of GIC, our SWF
2. His wife, is the CEO of Temasek Holdings, another SWF.  And we are told her salary is a secret, but why?
3. We are told we cannnot know what our reserves are, because it'll be ""harmful"", though all other SWF reveals their performance and total reserve to their citizens.
4. The PAP keeps changing the constitution to restrict freedom of speech - POFMA, Public Order Act, etc
5. The PAP changed the constitution to allow a ""Reserved Presidency"", so their candidate of choice gets elected.
6. The President is supposed to be the 2nd Key to our reserves.
7. The PAP kept asking for a strong (ultimate) mandate and won't (or are afraid) of more alternative voices.
8.  The PAP is ""deadly"" scared of having more alternative party members in Parliament to question our state finances.
9. The PAP kept our elections unfair, and kept changing the rules and boundaries to disadvantage the opposition.
10. The PAP clamps down HARD on dissenting voices, using tools such as lawsuits and legislation.
11.  The PAP has total control over our mainstream media, which tout the PAP's success, while glossing over their lapses (Keppel, Suzhou, YOG, NOL/SPH, etc).

Is that not telling you something?
As with our MRT, as with the Covid situation in the dorminitories, we cannot say that we have not been warned.

i7vzmo,1597166870,i7vzmo,111,,"I just got out of a HR intern position.

Prior to the 80% wage subsidy of the SG Traineeship being avaliable, we were scouting for a Operations Manager with a budget of around 3.5k/month.

However after news broke that this new SG Traineeship scheme was avaliable, we were instructed by the boss to hire for the role under SG traineeships instead and offer 2.5k to the applicant. We managed to get a NUS honours graduate for the position. 

Though it may not be representative of all companies, it appears to me that at least in this case, hiring is determined by the operational necessity of the company rather than the cost of wages.

If a production process requires 10 people and we only have 9, the boss is willing to pay whatever the market demands to fill the 10th position, so long as there is still some profit left over.

If the production process requires 10 people and we have filled all 10 positions, even if the government gives 90% subsidy, it is hard to convince the boss to pay the additional 10% wages as it leads to no additional profit on his side.

According to the HR Manager, there was no checks to ensure this wouldn't happen and the application just required a submission of some traineeship programme and how the traineeship is supposed to ""add value"" to the applicant, which we were able to BS out quite easily.

I think SG traineeships is an admirable initiative in principle, but alot of companies are quite cunning and will utilise the grant money to subsidise positions they already budgeted for anyway, instead of generating new jobs.

Currently there is nothing stopping companies from retrenching existing PMETs that earn 4 to 5k and rehiring uni grads for the same positon at 2.5k.

I can't speak for all companies, but I think in the current form the program may be subject to misuse by unscrupulous companies.

The subsidised manpower offered by SG traineeships should not be utilised to replace existing operational labour, but should instead be directed towards the creation of new economic activities to prepare companies for Post Covid operation (e.g. Inventorizing products for online sales)

There should be some check to ensure this is done, such as requesting for employment records to ensure trainees are not used to replace existing workers, or the production of the company's gray literature (e.g. Upgrading plans) to prove that the employee will be utilised for new economic activity.

illi12,1599102122,illi12,115,,"Just saw yesterday's speech by PM in parliament. IMO its worth a listen - probably one of the most important speeches by the PM in the last few years.

I thought it was a great performance by our PM. He spoke on most of the hot button issues making the rounds recently, including foreign worker quotas, COVID-19, and the state of politics in Singapore. I felt that it was a great speech in which he clearly explained the government's concerns and needs and why they made certain decisions, and reassured Singaporeans that the government really had their back. More importantly, he sent a clear message to his PAP team and the opposition on how he wants politics to be conducted, and recognized the need for competition to keep his team on their toes. Pritam and PM had a great debate as well. I thought PM's nuanced point during the debate, that ""tactical voting"" was dangerous and should not be encouraged, was very fair. He instead encouraged people to vote for anyone, even the opposition on their merits, even if the merits are simply ""we will run your town council well and be a reasonable, effective opposition"".

So I was disappointed to see reddit responding to this article which took the most controversial part of his speech as clickbait: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/il64ey/pm\_lee\_calls\_wp\_voters\_free\_riders\_will\_end\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/il64ey/pm_lee_calls_wp_voters_free_riders_will_end_up/)

godex7,1590125614,godex7,119,,"Hello everyone it is me again. Since now work has slowed down quite a bit and everyone is working from home, more time for me to learn more about Reddit so I have been reading the discussions on NDP this year. If you don't mind, I would like to share my 2-3 cent worth on the issue as an ex-Regular (if you see my Q&amp;A last time my proof is there). Before you shoot me down, hear me out!

Back when I was still in the force, I was involved with quite a few NDPs. Because we are Infantry and we have the highest composition in the vocation, naturally we would be activated to help out in various aspects of the NDP. I think easily I would have done at least 10 NDPs, save for a few years when either we werent needed or I had time off due to family matters (wife was giving birth and some other complications). Long story short, I was involved with funpack packing (yes regulars are also part of the action, not just NSFs), area operations, security, and other parts of planning. Strangely enough, I was never part of the actual parade haha. Those involved with NDP before - let me share that come June - Sep period, I get super sian of the KFC. Everytime my family/friends want to eat KFC, i always tell them to count me out and carry on haha.

I think with all the recent discussions about NDP, there are two aspects to it: (1) the need for NDP this year; and (2) the funpack issue.

For (1), I strongly believe that there is a space for NDP, no matter the circumstances that we are in. You may call NDP wayang, one day special then next day return to normal, etc., but that is exactly what it is. For that one day, we are allowed to momentarily forget about our troubles, and to celebrate what NDP is all about - our Singapore. From the average Singaporean to the Ministers, we all know that the next day on 10 Aug, life goes back to normal. We face the same troubles, same struggles at work. However, on 9 Aug we collectively celebrate as a nation - celebrating the struggles, the triumphs and all inbetween that we have faced as a nation. I guess this year it is especially more significant, because of the common threat/struggle that we all face. And I would say - this is even more so a good reason to hold NDP. Why? It is because we are saying, as one nation, that despite all the hurdles that we have, keep calm and carry on. Life still goes on, we still grow one year older as a nation, and we can still celebrate. Covid can rob us of the daily routines, the anxiety and stress as workers and families, but it can never rob us of the capacity and ability to create joy even in the darkest moments. I remember times like in 1967 and even when late president S R Nathan was at an OCS commissioning parade and it rained heavily, but the parade still carried on, and even he inspected the parade in the rain. Life still goes on, and we can overcome any adversity. This is the true message behind holding NDP.

For (2), I have mixed thoughts about it. We always think about money - how it can be better used. One of the very common questions we always face from the public back in the planning function in the SAF is that, how can you justify the cost? There will always be people arguing that the cost of one tank or one artillery platform can feed more needy people, can fund social spending, etc. To be honest, I don't have an answer. But what I can say is this:

* Planning for the next year's NDP starts the day after the current NDP ends. No joke. The moment Aug 9 ends, the next year's EXCO starts their very first meeting on 11 Aug, usually with a AAR (okay la, 2 days after haha)
* As what some have pointed out, quite a lot of the items in the funpack are sponsored items (the NDP committee does not spend that money). You have sponsors like Khong Guan, Old Chang Kee, Lifebuoy, etc etc who contribute items in the funpack, it is their choice to do so. The NDP committee can advise on what items to contribute, but ultimately it is their call to see how to spend their money as commercial entities. Plus usually these are usually contractual to a couple of years, so there is a commitment period there from what I know
* Re-routing money that has been legally approved for certain functions is not easily. I'm not that versed in finance, but I know that with regard to public monies, how it is used is governed very strictly because of the strict audit issues and policies in place on how to utilise the money. This may be a common misconception, but the money cannot be just suka suka lump and route somewhere else - because of policies, the signature of doing so, and other legal implications.

Yup sorry so maybe it is not just 2-3 cent but maybe more like 80 cents haha. But you get my idea (sorry for the haphazard English) and I hope that you all can consider different perspectives of NDP as well :)",,Is NDP still relevant during this time?

Local Branding &amp; PR Agency A got a nice creative cover letter from me because I like the vibes of the agency. They realised I'd be completely out of their budget, and were nice and upfront about it. I politely rescinded my application, and agreed to stay in touch for future opportunities. I have also suggested that others join Agency A, because they seem to be a decent employer.

Local Healthcare company B was super eager to interview me. I tentatively agreed, and googled the address. Too far for me, as I'm a Westie and they're in a super ulu industrial estate in the east. Burning 3+ hours a day to commute back/forth would not be sustainable, so I called back to cancel within 10 minutes. (Also: I have no idea what the working hours are, or what the OT expectations are like.)

Local Marketing Agency C initially agreed to $3k for 2.5 days of work each week, with 2 days being fixed, and the last 0.5 day subject to the agency's needs. Was ok with that because it means I have bandwidth to take on other projects, until I received the offer. It was 6 months' probation, NO fixed days (meaning I need to standby for all days instead of just 3), and I quote: **""You are to send the company a summary of the work you have done by the last day of the month in order for our Finance to process payment.""** Don't get me started on the typos and other major red flags.

Local Startup D looked perfect at the start. It would be a small paycut and a faster pace of work (which I can cope with), but had a more focused jobscope and interesting industry. Pleasant and smart team members; all interesting characters, but had the right vibes. Big boss is a super nice guy, and I knew the company was financially healthy. 3 rounds later, they decided to not fill that role because change of direction.

Local Comms Agency E asked if I've been out of work for 6 months. Alarm bells ringing (coz there are additional grants if companies hire people who are unemployed for 6+ mths), I politely continued the interview like I didn't realise anything. Then stated my minimum salary expectations, and moved on. Of course, they didn't contact me anymore after.

Local Startup F's HR interviewed me with a noisy toddler running around. (Yes, it's tough being a parent, but could she not be in a separate room?) Then they asked me for a go-to-market plan, AND a writing task to streamline their site. No confirmed presentation date. Really? I'm not giving ideas AND plans for free, especially when there's no talk about estimated compensation. Checked on LinkedIn later; they appear to have hired an FT with 2 years less exp.

Local Startup G was much like D, except I performed an analysis of their revenue streams, and knew that their business model would be highly unlikely to succeed. (Their space has a very high barrier to entry &amp; profitability.) Unless they can nasi kang kang their whale investor to cough up a generous warchest for user acquisitions.

Good luck to them, and I say this in good faith. Because I hope the people working for these companies survive the difficult market with their sanity and dignity intact.

Hello... Now is economic crisis and pandemic, yes...

But the crisis hasn't made people stupid.

The staff mentioned that since ""we were stuck at home"" they figured we had more time to help. I barely could help myself with my workload btw. So I rejected it. I'm not helping if I can't help myself - at the end KPI matters the most when the axe falls.

For me WFH gave the company a chance to abuse our working hours and made us clear leave - yet asking us what is our plan to work during our leave. Questioning us about our low output of work during leave and threatening our job security.

TLDR - Boss nonchalantly asked me to break the law for a short meeting, turns out the purpose is to make me do extra work out of my jobscope. I can't even handle my own workload.

&gt; To be very honest, I was a little touched (at first) when I saw this email appearing in my mailbox earlier today. So Grab had sent me (and I’m pretty sure thousands of other F&amp;B operators) a timely message, titled “Adapting to Circuit Breaker mode”. *my heart feels fuzzy*
&gt; 
&gt; For all those who are unaware, the big green is massively expanding right now and killing it with non-stop islandwide delivery orders and a whole lot of other delivery services. They are on-boarding restaurants and merchants faster than our PM can change language settings and growing their delivery fleet rapidly to a scale possibly larger than Donald’s ego.
&gt; 
&gt; The Singapore government had announced recently that they will step in with a budget allocated to get delivery platforms to help subsidise the delivery charges and reduce the commission rates for the badly hit F&amp;B sector. You can tell how EXCITED I was to see this email. I’ve attached part of the email for everyone’s reading pleasure.
&gt; 
&gt; So I run a small little F&amp;B business (just 1 outlet), and the recent CB measurements plus everything leading up to the ban of dining in restaurants (which I completely understand and agree that it’s the right thing to do) has obviously greatly impacted business. Having said that, I spoke with my team back in end March (even before #CB mode announcement) to let them know that I will keep them all on their full payrolls over this tough period but we will all have to work hard together to overcome this challenging scenario where our income will crash significantly and our cashflows get more and more tight. So unless we learn to pivot the business quickly, we might not be around long enough to see the light at the end of the tunnel (or even if we do, it could be from an incoming train, #justkidding).
&gt; 
&gt; With that, we started to plan to get ourselves ready for the “digital transformation” to adopt online delivery and takeaway. I started to build an ordering site for our own in-house delivery ordering even though we were on GrabFood and Foodpanda already. The simple reason is that the commission rates have been too detrimental (and always increasing since their inception) to us as an F&amp;B, we just don’t have the margins to survive if orders keep going through delivery apps. I used a free online shopping cart system for small businesses available online and got our v1 delivery ordering site up within a day and launched it on 31st March. It was nothing fancy but capable of taking online orders immediately plus it was free to use and charges only the credit card transaction fees for all orders so we can retain our margins.
&gt; 
&gt; Back to the real story.
&gt; 
&gt; For simplicity sake, I shall casually break this down for part by part so that everyone can follow. I’m no guru but this was just my observation and calculation to understand the feasibility of us F&amp;Bs surviving thru this if we rely on the delivery apps.
&gt; 
&gt; Just so it happens, I have an actual case that we can based this story on. Refer to attached photos.
&gt; 
&gt; A typical delivery app charges anything between 30-35% off the order amount to the F&amp;B outlet, citing to cover transactions fees, platform fees and delivery charges (which technically is paid by the customer) etc. So when an F&amp;B outlet sells say $30 worth of food and drinks say for 2 mains and 1 side (which is a typical basket size for 2 adults), the outlet will get approximately $19.50 back.
&gt; 
&gt; Moving on, if the F&amp;B outlet chooses to run a promotion (which helps entice customers to order more… so they say), we can do so but the outlet will have to bear the full value of the promotion or discount. So say I offer a $3 discount off delivery charges if a customer orders up to $30 worth from us. Done deal. Happy.
&gt; 
&gt; So here’s the magic, when a customer goes to the Grab app and finds a cool restaurant that delivers islandwide now and proceeds to order $30 worth of food, then gets a $3 discount off delivery fees…
&gt; 
&gt; “Beep Beep Beep, Beep Beep Beep”, the holland inspired orange delivery terminal rings, indicating that a new order has came in. The F&amp;B outlet crew smiles because they are in business.
&gt; 
&gt; When you look at the printed order ticket, it shows $30 worth of food ordered, $3 discount enjoyed by the customer, and so a net sale of $27. Well, that’s right as promised. So basically, the outlet will receive $27 minus 30-35% commission which works out to be a grand total of $17.55, for 2 mains and 1 side (for this case illustration).
&gt; 
&gt; So the typical food cost of a standard F&amp;B (excluding fine dining establishments) is around 25-30%, meaning to sell $30 worth of food and drinks, the cost works out to be around $9, that is usually excluding packaging costs for delivery, which can be around $1-1.50 for takeaway bowls, cups, trays to hold the drinks and paper bags to store the order. Bear in mind, that is excluding the utilities, rent and manpower costs that are currently all still in full swing so as to operate the outlet to have a shot at doing delivery and takeout.
&gt; 
&gt; To keep it simple, Iet’s just count the total cost to be $12 (which should be more but oh well). That means, the outlet earns $17.55 - $12 = $5.55 for that order. I’m simplifying everything so don’t fault me if you feel that this is wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; You must be wondering, where am I getting at ?
&gt; 
&gt; So now let’s go to what a customer who is placing the order sees on their delivery app screen. $30 worth of food and drinks, check. Add to cart, enjoys $3 discount off delivery, check. Service fees $14.50 check. Total bill charged to credit card $41.50 (instead of the UP of $44.50), check. Use an altitude card to earn some miles, perfecto !
&gt; 
&gt; Wait… what ? $14.50 of service fees ?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, as we all know, when you are running an empire, there is bound to be some overheads that you need to cover, a platform fee to pay for the IPs that they have created, money to fund the growth of the company for expansion and also to pay the drivers for their hard work. So let’s break it down now, $14.50 for a 8.5km distance delivery for a basket size of $27, that’s just a 45-50% service fee for my order, pretty darn good for these times yo. Well, in such times, we should all support our #LocalHeroes they say.
&gt; 
&gt; So I was interested to work out the truth between the values - When a customer pays $41.50, the outlet receives $17.55 for the same order, credit card company charges around $1.25 (approx 3% transaction fee on the $41.50) which leaves us with a difference of $22.70 in between. The part that I cannot answer (but if someone else knows, please leave it in the comments!) is how much the delivery rider earns in this challenging time.
&gt; 
&gt; From basic speed distance calculations, I would estimate a 8.5km delivery to take around 12-15 mins based on an average speed of 40km/h which is super safe and comfortable given the current “carefree” state of traffic, maybe add in 5-10 mins for waiting at traffic lights and parking and walking to the units. When we fulfil our in-house deliveries where we work with freelance riders, some of whom have been affected by the current shutdown, sorry I mean circuit breaker situation, we are offering around $6-8 for a short distance delivery and $8-12 for a longer distance fulfilment, I know its not a lot but its what we can offer given our own plight. But let’s just assume for a moment that the delivery app driver can get $8.50 from this 8.5km delivery, pretty fair right ? So does that mean the delivery app earns $22.70 - $8.50 = $14?
&gt; 
&gt; Now let’s compare them side by side :
&gt; 
&gt; Outlet gets $17.55 (well technically earns $5.55 after factoring in the cost of the team to cook, paying rent and utilities, play COGS to offer a customer 2 mains and 1 side)
&gt; Driver gets $8.50 (for 8.5km delivery, covers petrol costs and time)
&gt; Delivery App gets $14 (for… being them)
&gt; 
&gt; Well, THERE IS ALWAYS A SILVER LINING !
&gt; 
&gt; As mentioned briefly above, the Singapore government is introducing a Food Delivery Booster Package* aka a sizeable amount of resources and budget to help, quote “Support for offering food delivery services (Deliveroo, Foodpanda and/or GrabFood)” and “Support for offering food delivery services (via third party logistics players)”. So when I saw the email coming from the Grab, I was damn hopeful.
&gt; 
&gt; *Read about that here (https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/industries/type/food-services/food-delivery-booster-package)
&gt; 
&gt; Then I read the caring and heartwarming message from Grab (and I highlighted the most beautiful paragraph in our local Singapore Red no less), “ESG Food Delivery Booster Plan - Up to 5% commission reduction”.
&gt; 
&gt; (Cue Coldplay’s The Scientist)
&gt; 
&gt; “No…body… said it would be easy… No one ever said it would be this hard”
&gt; 
&gt; I won’t bother to calculate the savings that the outlet would potentially enjoy from the 5% commission reduction (it’s up to 5% so meaning can be less guys?), but hey for the fun of it… I WILL calculate it since we have so much time during this CB period.
&gt; 
&gt; Now take $27 less 30% commission instead of the usual 35%.
&gt; 
&gt; TADA !
&gt; 
&gt; The outlet now gets back $18.90 instead of $17.55, which I truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank the Singapore government for stepping in to subsidise this.
&gt; 
&gt; PS. Kudos to Lalamove, who together with ESG will fund 20 per cent of the delivery cost per trip for orders made between 7 April and 4 May 2020. *Slow Clap*
&gt; 
&gt; So there you have it everyone… my geeky post for the day. For those looking at your delivery apps right now, thinking about what to order in for dinner, supper or whatever meal is it, I encourage you to order directly from your favourite outlets by going to their websites, calling them, WhatsApping them or sliding into their DMS on IG to place your order instead. And if you drive or ride, or are physically nearby, offer to pick it up from their outlets instead of having it delivered. You could do with the short breath of fresh air.
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer : I’m not discouraging anyone to use delivery apps, I merely wanted to present what I learnt today and it’s a hell of a wonderful business model to be honest. The truth is, a lot of people will continue to order from the delivery apps coz its convenient, well laid out and designed. Unfortunately, in times like these, numerous F&amp;Bs will soon die because of the Einstein level math as described above.
&gt; 
&gt; Note to Grab : Please don’t ban my account. I still will use you guys !
&gt; 
&gt; Pardon me as I take off my Sherlock hat and go to the neighbourhood Kopitiam to takeaway some food for dinner, to support the small local businesses and hawkers who might not be able to get through this covid19 pandemic unscathed.

Every traffic light I go to, its at least 2 to 5 grab/food panda delivery riders. Its insane if you think about it.

It's not sustainable to have everyone doing grabfood, because not only does it make it more difficult for those who did grabfood from the start and now have to compete, but it also points towards the unstable trend of gig economy workers that we currently have given the current climate.

I mean, there's only so many people who can do grab food before you have an oversupply of delivery riders and not enough people ordering right?

If anything, my personal opinion is that the SG United jobs are being paid far too little to mitigate this. Yes, I know it's a pandemic and it's better to have a job than none at all, but come on, 1.5k a month is going to be really difficult when Singapore is that expensive right?

Now, I am not the most informed citizen, and certainly not the most intelligent, so feel free to flame or bash or educate me if I am wrong in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

I just had a ""heated argument"" with my parents on the topic of Circuit Breaker and the current state of Singapore (having a huge surge in the number of cases the past few days). For some context I am 21 and my parents are in their 50s (we're all Singaporeans), and the argument started with them commenting ""if LKY was still around none of this would have happened"".

Their argument was fairly simple, that the government did not do enough during this period of time and that they should have been stricter with their measures, implementing them earlier or being clearer. ""LKY would have immediately said 'Lockdown' and 'Quarantine' rather than roundabout terms like 'SHN' and 'Circuit Breaker'. To which I responded that I don't think Singapore's current situation was a result of inadequate governance (that they did do a decent enough job compared to other countries in introducing measures such as advisories, giving out free supplies etc.) but rather a populace that refused to listen to advisories and the like. They refuted with ""you tell me what the government has done lorh"" and I listed some of the things that the government has implemented in recent months, since this entire bugaloo started in Jan.

Their first point of contention was that the ""SHN"" wasn't clear enough at the start. My mother mentioned that she had a conversation with her boss whose daughter had received a SHN but in it's first iterations the SHN wasn't clear in stating that the person who had received the noticed needed to be isolated from the other family members else it is rendered pointless if the other family members come into consistent contact with said person and leave the house. It was only clarified later that whoever received the SHN had to be isolated. To which my response was that it should've been common sense that whoever received the SHN should have been isolated, and we didn't need the government to spell it out for us, and the fact that we did shows that our populace had failed to read in between the lines that the SHN was in fact a quarantine notice. 

Another point of contention was that the ""Circuit Breaker"" should have started earlier, DORSCON should have been raised to red, and the government should have just called it a lockdown. I argued that it would've caused mass panic if CB was straight up termed as a lockdown or if DORSCON was raised to red, seeing that people were already crowding super markets before PM Lee even made the CB announcement. I also mentioned that while it's true that CB could have been implemented earlier, it wasn't necessary as we did not have too many cases in Feb and early March, with some days not having any new cases (I am aware of the incubation period, but I am sure in purely numerical terms, the situation in Singapore was not as serious in the early periods compared to now). I also mentioned that there were significant economic consequences in implementing CB, and hence why the government did not want to implement it earlier (I do admit this is a fairly flawed argument, ethically speaking lives should be more important than economy), but the government did strongly encourage working from home and staying home as much as possible before dropping the CB bomb. I then brought up the fact that even with CB in place, some of the populace still refuse to listen (I'm specifically referring to those with a choice, choosing to intentionally flout the rules when it is entirely reasonable for them to stay home), and it shows that the populace acted (and some of us still are acting) in a really incomprehensibly stupid manner. 

My parents also briefly mentioned that the government should have encouraged wearing of masks rather than their initial stance of only wearing a mask if you are sick, because Singaporeans are very 乖 (obedient) and we will listen to whatever the government says, but that only shows how brainless and sheeple-ish we are if we need the government to step in and spell out everything in black and white for us. That we need the government to say very loudly and very clearly then we will do. In summary, my argument is that the a good portion of the populace didn't act intelligently and responsibly, and the only counter-argument I got was ""Aiya he's so stubborn don't bother arguing with him"" (because god forbid forming an actual counter argument instead of personally attacking my character traits am I right?).

Of course I edited out all the shouting during the argument, but I'm aware I probably didn't word everything too well either. But now I turn to reddit for opinions, and critiques to my own opinion.

folb52,1585116486,folb52,127,,"Just got back a few days ago, and now I'm under the SHN staying in a hotel. Just thought I'd collate some resources, experiences, and expectations to help those coming back in the coming days. According to the hotel I'm in, it's still quite a new programme implemented on 22nd March, so they're working out the kinks also as it goes along, but so far so good.

**Arrival**

\-At the immigration hall, there will be a group briefing in batches by ICA officers. Forms, notices for the SHN, declaration, etc. will be made there. Once you're done, you get a lovely neon pink sticker and get to clear through immigration. Note that you have to declare where you're staying for your SHN.

\-Note day of arrival is Day 0, so in effect, you'll be staying **15 nights** in the hotel. MOM has a calculator here: [https://service2.mom.gov.sg/shn/shn-calculator/](https://service2.mom.gov.sg/shn/shn-calculator/)

The day you get to ""return to work"" is the day you check out.

\-**NON-UK/US Students:** Once you're through immigration, you're in a sense, free to make your way to your SHN at your own means. This is where you exercise your social responsibility and not head to any public places. Yes, Jewel is quite empty now, shake shack has not much of a queue... but please, no. 

\-**UK/US Students:** For those students returning from UK/US, gahmen will choose for you. According to the press release you get ushered straight into buses to go there.

**Checking In**

\-The reception and concierge should give you a thorough briefing as you check in. If you've taken up their meal plan they will give you the menu and arrangements. This would probably differ from each hotel. The hotel I'm in has very nice counter staff who offered to help  buy some food/drinks nearby if they are free. However, remember the frontline people have other SHN people to deal with too. Be nice with them.

\-Important: You CANNOT use the pool/gym, and no you cannot walk out of your room once you're in. So don't keep trying to ask them about where can you go. At my current hotel, the room card is programmed to be a one-time use card. If you get out, they'll know. Please don't go spoil market and do something stupid during this time.

\-SHN Checks: I was told that officers might randomly come. Procedure is that they will call the room, and we will likely have to go down to the lobby to show ourselves (don't ask me why). Apparently the hotel is private property so they can't just show up at the room door. They will eventually head to the room of course if you don't answer.

I've not experienced this yet. I've only got the sms/location sharing text, to check where I am. However, if they come, I get to walk out of the room for some air at last, haha.

\-Food will be placed outside your door during meal times. Trash placed outside. Laundry will be placed outside also if you need to get it done.

\-If anyone wants to pass you stuff, they leave it at the concierge, vice versa if you want to send something out. Food delivery done the same way. Again, concierge staff will be used for this, so please don't overload them. 50 rooms doing grabfood at the same time is a little insane for them I think. Maybe setup some kind of telegram group or whatever to group order and try to help out the concierge.

f3abqn,1581602185,f3abqn,128,,"For a virus that is most fatal to boomers, the things boomers circulate angers me. Attempts to educate them and point out falsehoods often fall on deaf ears.

The most frustrating and saddest part in this is that these boomers can be your love ones, like you parents and older relatives who doted and cared for you when you were little.

Below are some messages I came across, what else did you guys come across and how did you overcome the 'OK Boomer' barrier?

**Example 1**

SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.  Everyone should ensure your mouth &amp; throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That's very dangerous. Pl remind everyone about this !

**Example 2**

There are 1.46 million people in Lanling County, Shandong Province. No one is currently infected, which has attracted the attention of relevant experts. According to statistics from the local government, nearly 10,000 migrant workers who work and sell vegetables in Wuhan have returned to their hometown for the Spring Festival.  The reason is that Lanling is a garlic planting area. At present, garlic seedlings are growing well in the farmland of Lanling. It will emit natural allicin to sterilize and cut off the infection. In addition, Lanling people work in Wuhan to sell vegetables.  Garlic, like to eat garlic, will not be easily infected.  This phenomenon has been widely valued by the medical community.  Don't be afraid to taste, you must eat more!

**Example 3**

My classmate's uncle and nephew, graduated with a master's degree, and work in Shenzhen Hospital.  He is being transferred to study Wuhan pneumonia virus.  He just called me and told me to tell my friends: If you have a runny nose and sputum when you have a cold, you cannot be a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, because coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough without runny nose. This is the simplest way to identify.  Please tell your friends that if you know more about medical knowledge, you will have more awareness of identification and prevention. 

This time, the Wuhan virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed at a temperature of 26-27 degrees. Therefore, drink more hot water. You can tell your friends and relatives to drink more hot water to prevent it.

 It has been cold recently, and drinking hot water is also very comfortable. It is not a cure and is good for the body. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink ice, remember!

**Example 4**

Zhong Nanshan (a Chinese pulmonologist who discovered the SARS coronavirus in 2003) suggested simple ways to prevent Wuhan pneumonia:

It is recommended that you rinse your throat with light salt water before going to the hospital or other public places (and do the same after you return home). The method is as follows:

a) hold a mouthful of dilute salt water;

b) raise your head; let the salt water stay around your throat area

c) open your mouth slightly and exhale slowly, let air bubbling through the water in your throat and make a ""ha"" sound

d) spit out the salt water after a few seconds

e) repeat 3-5 times

Because viruses or bacteria lurk in the pharynx through the nasal passage, diluted salt water can kill them on the spot, thereby achieving the purpose of preventing infection. During SARS, I promoted and supervised this method among my students. As a result, none of our students in our class got cold, cough and fever.

This method is simple, effective, easy to do. But requires persevere.",,COVID-19 - The 'OK Boomer' Edition,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f3abqn/covid19_the_ok_boomer_edition/

hyulac,1595864430,hyulac,129,,"Hello all.

Ahgong died 2 weeks ago (he died right after elections, lol, I got home from Hougang 322 celebrating the WP and shit hit the fan) so here's my own perspective on how a fast game, no-frills ceremony ends in case anyone would like to know for future reference.

For relevance, ahgong fell down about a week or so before GE. After a while in hospital, he went home and went into delirium - high fever, unable to properly talk, unable to go toilet, shat his pants constantly etc.

Right after election (again, no political link even though he was badass and political af but I'm just using that day as a reference point), he had a stroke in the morning and by 1300hrs he was gone after the doctors confirmed his DNR.

So here's how it works in the current world of covid and all (as always, based on my own experience so take with pinch of salt and all and everything varies):

* Upon death, they contact you, obviously
* He went into A&amp;E but right now visitors are severely restricted- it was 2 max when the ambulance came for him, and after that they said it's **2 max for immediate family**
* Upon death, you don't get to see the body. They need to test for Covid19 **immediately** in case the deceased did kena Covid. In this period, they advise everyone in the family who had contact to stay the fuck home till further notice
* Once Covid swab test is clear, they release the body
* I will add that my family had a super dark joke moment at this point- my dad went ""eh ahgong's swab test is clear, no covid"" and my brother and I went ""oh not like it's gonna really help him at this point now, right?""
* Anyway casket company will then collect the body for processing - put in coffin, embalming, whatever. They gotta wait till the Covid test too
* If you opt for No Wake (esp in this Covid era, ahgong wanted it that way), it's insanely efficient. Within 24 hours we had a slot at Mandai Crematorium
* Arrive at Mandai. Realise there is a **fucking long queue**, like there were 2 services scheduled before ahgong so we had to sit there and lepak and wait while seeing the hearse queue
* Brother leans over to me and whispers ""*Ghana Coffin Dance""*. I am suddenly glad to be wearing a mask cos I'm grinning like an idiot in the middle of Mandai
* 2 funerals later. Ahgong is rolled in. I thought we need to carry *a la LKY funeral* but nope, there's a ceremonial forklift thingy
* Pastor does his thing. Casket staff ask if they can remove cover, ask us to place flowers on casket, ask permission from Dad (ahgong's Firstborn) to cover casket
* Ceremonial forklift comes back. We all head to the Viewing Gallery
* Casket company puts on triumphant Christian Music. I'm kinda weirded out and wondering if I can ask for Astronomia to be blasted if I die early.
* Ahgong's casket is loaded onto Ceremonial Forklift Track Two. Attendant looks up and asks for permission. Dad gives thumbs up.
* Casket begins to move down tracks. I realise how Mandai's architecture works- it's all stone walls rising up because of the chimney.
* Casket enters oven. Auto doors close. Everyone cries. Casket staff says ""that's it""
* We move downstairs. Normally there would be a reception hall but Covid and all so we sit there awkwardly.

Next morning:

* Wake up. Drive to Mandai. Ashes are in a Toyogo box.
* I expected powder. Nope. We get bones. Pieces of bones. Casket staff try to cheer us up by telling us how **stronk** ahgong was- his bones are still intact even after the furnace, we can see the joints and all
* As the sons and grandsons, Dad and my brothers and I take a piece each of the bones and place it into the spread-out cloth on the table
* Cloth is tied. We move off to Changi Point (the same place you take Ubin Ferry)
* Arrive. Sea condition sucks balls. We wait. Finally they let us onboard.
* Ferry goes out to halfway between Singapore and Chek Jawa (only recognise it because of my job of bringing kids to Ubin all the time)
* Pastor goes out and prays
* Parents hold cloth over the sea then release
* Everyone takes turns to throw flowers
* Life Pro Tip: don't clusterfuck, bumboat is stable AF but 5-6 ppl on the back deck, confirm rock like fuck especially on a choppy sea day
* And that's all. Sit down. Go home. Bye.

Other helpful tips:

* Give angbao to the hearse driver, the funeral attendants and basically anyone involved, if you're Chinese. IDK about how other races do it, I'm sorry please don't make police report
* For fuck's sakes if it's Sea Burial, don't clusterfuck on back deck, you don't want to join your deceased relative do you?
* **Do not yeet your deceased's remains into the sea**. My dad legit thought that he was meant to that till the casket staff advised him otherwise
* Sleep early and eat a proper breakfast on the burial day. There was a fucking long queue at Changi for the sea burials. We had **eight different casket vans including Indian etc** in the carpark on that day...and given that there is only one approved spot from what we heard, better prepare for a queue.

There seems to be an outpour of anti-establishment rhetoric these past few days. While I agree that perhaps some of it might come as heavy-handed (e.g. PAP's press release on Raeesah Khan), I hope more people realise this is just politicking that is to be expected in an election.

Amidst all the hoo-ha about our candidate's backgrounds, their internet history and POFMA, all of us really need to be objective as to what the government has achieved in the past 5 years.

We seem to be focusing on the bad. This includes the passing of legislation such as changes to the Elected Presidency and POFMA. Some might want to add on the lack of transparency in our GLCs and SWFs. I will not point these issues out as most people have already done so in the subreddit over the past few days.

I will be pointing out the policies the government has passed through since 2015 so that we can have a **balanced understanding** in deciding whether all not the ruling party is really as bad as what the social media seems to frame them these days.

In a normal election year, arguably the biggest issue would have been the GST increase from 7% to 9%. Whether or not this is necessary I believe only MOF themselves and professional economists can answer. It is important to note that Singapore does face an ageing population and no amount of massaging will allow us to skirt away from rising healthcare and infrastructure costs in the next decade.

COVID-19 has arguably changed the election context massively. Now we are not even talking about whether the GST increase is necessary (has been delayed), rather how do we prevent the massive unemployment that is certain to arise in the near future. Also, the crisis has probably blinded us from the key issues that were discussed prior to 2020. 

These are some of the policies I believed have been passed through since 2015. I am not saying whether they are successful or beneficial, as this will take 5-10 years for us to realise. It is up to you to form your own opinion on whether these policies are sufficient or more can be done. I have added on some compared to the comment I made previously.

**Changes to Laws**

\- Reform of the penal code. This introduced new laws covering sexual exploitation and doxxing. Some may suggest that 377A should have been changed, but I think that may require another 10-15 years before any real changes will be made to it. [https://www.mha.gov.sg/newsroom/press-release/news/commencement-of-amendments-to-the-penal-code-and-other-legislation-on-1-january-2020](https://www.mha.gov.sg/newsroom/press-release/news/commencement-of-amendments-to-the-penal-code-and-other-legislation-on-1-january-2020) 

\- Other changes to laws would include changes to the Family Justice System.

**Healthcare**

\- Merdeka Generation Package and extension of CHAS for those with chronic health conditions. Quite important since this group will be ageing and will ultimately require greater healthcare support in the near future. [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/national-day-rally-2018-8-things-you-need-to-know-from-pm-lees-speech](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/national-day-rally-2018-8-things-you-need-to-know-from-pm-lees-speech)

\- Plans for new hospitals and polyclinics. This includes Sengkang General Hospital, which opened in 2018. Also, there are plans to build a new community hospital in the East by 2030 and 6 new polyclinics by 2023, with a further 6 by 2030.

**Retirement Age and CPF**

\- Increase in retirement age. I think there has been a misunderstanding regarding the raising of the retirement age from 62 to 65 (by 2030). It does not mean you have to work **until** you are 65, rather that only when you are 65 can the company force you to retire. This ultimately allows the largest proportion of our workforce (those currently 40-50 ish) to continue working and reduce our reliance on foreign labour. 

\- Raised the CPF contribution rates for workers aged 55 and above, with CPF draw out age still remaining at 55.

**Education**

Before I state what has been done, this is the area that I feel will have the greatest impact in the next few years, especially since it is a rather major reform in our education system.

I may have missed out some policies, so if there are others who think of it feel free to add on.

My point in making this post was the same when I made the comment. Most comments by people will be emotionally charged given that it is election season. As a voter, I urge you to ignore all the politicking by both sides, rather focus solely on the manifesto and the policies they suggest. Think through whether they are possible or just plain rubbish. For the ruling party, I do not think they are perfect, but I don't think it is fair if we simply brush aside the better policies that were implemented in the past few years.

The context is for giving Singaporeans a fixed amount a week ($110) to get through the COVID-19 pandemic period.

The potential benefits of this welfare system includes alleviating the lower income households from the financial strains they are burdened by and also helping out the SME that are struggling in this period. The downside is that Singapore is a small and open economy and has relatively low consumption level and high import expenditure, which will limit the extent of the benefits and can even lead to leakages outside the economy.

1. KFC. Their prices have gone up quite fast. Maybe it's comparable to other chicken outlets, but I've stopped going there for a while now
2. Burger King. Maybe it's the outlets which I go to, but the service is ridiculously slow.

The ad promised a salary of 1.7k excluding OT and other allowances. 1.7k for a factory job, why not? 

After my aunt was offered, she was told that the 1.7k consisted of $700 Basic Salary + $1k ""Fixed Allowance"". We were quite perplexed as to why they'd want to divide the salary into two different components. 

Turns out, this is a very smart tactic used to cut down on OT cost. I did some math, and here's what I found

When your basic is 1.7, your hourly rate is $8.9, so OT rate at 1.5 times is arnd 13.35. 

But when you break it down into 700 + 1000, your hourly rate is based on the 700 basic. So in this case the OT rate at 1.5x became 5.5 dollars per hour! 

Then when you OT a lot, the difference adds up. So if you OT 30 hours in that month, using 1.7k base will give you 2.1k+ before CPF per month. But when you use 700 base, it gives only 1.8k… a difference of almost 300 dollars!

gqv1yc,1590491533,gqv1yc,136,,"Covid really makes me appreciate food. Or rather, the scarcity of food during covid really makes me think a lot about the food wastage that we singaporeans create.

I was in charge of logistics and finance in kranji camp 3 during my ns. Hundreds of Kg (kilograms!!!!) of food was wasted per day. Why? Because we have to indent (aka order) sufficient food to feed our headcount in the units in kranji camp 3. If we have 600 soldiers, we need to order enough food for 600 soldiers. If we have 2000 soldiers, we order enough for 2000 soldiers. This is obviously designed so that everyone has enough food to eat (duh.) also this food amount has been analyzed to be “required” for a balanced and nutritious diet (aka its a fixed portion). This goes for all other camps in the army.

But! A lot of trainees (NSF) and reservists like to eat at canteens. Either that, or they prefer to pick whatever they want, then throw away the rest (eg eat chicken, throw away the rice and veggies and soup and everything else, then go to canteen for fried ice cream or carbonara with chicken chop).

Every single day I will be forced by the camp to go meet the cookhouse auntie to watch the food being thrown away, to incite us to action (ie they try to guilt trip me and my boss so we will punish recruits or NSF or reservists who eat at canteen instead of their indented cookhouse food). Why? Because if you don’t eat the cookhouse food, it gets thrown away (food safety means you cannot dabao and feed the poor, food only lasts 3 hours before you must discard or else it’s considered spoiled). So: because NSFs prefer to eat carbonara, we end up throwing away their entire portion of cai png.

I can tell you, it hurts. Whole trays of food (each dish has like 7-8 trays of 200 kg each, and there are like 8 dishes for each meal eg rich, fish, cabbage, soup, chicken, tofu, curry, milo, etc) so we end up discarding 300 to 400 kg per day in kranji. I weigh 90 kg and the food can reach up to 3 to 4 times my body weight, I’m estimating here. 

Let’s all please stop wasting food in army. We all must play a part. Eat whatever is ordered/indented for you. Don’t eat at the canteen unless you have already eaten your share of the cookhouse food that has been ordered for you. If you can eat 2 portions of lunch, go ahead and eat cookhouse then go eat canteen. But usually you will be too full by the time you are done with cookhouse food.

Let’s stop wasting food please I’m begging you. It’s not just kranji camp, all army camps are doing this. The food is frankly enough to feed thousands of people if you add it all up. That’s per day. Wasting food is so painful to watch, especially when you have to do it yourself. I still remember the cookhouse auntie asking me to help her pour away whole trays of chicken and rice and fish and cabbage and soup and drinks.",,Food wastage in army NS &amp; reservist,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gqv1yc/food_wastage_in_army_ns_reservist/

The Chinese uncle pick me up, he was complaining a bit making his journey to pick me up. And then the golden question pops up ""Are you Chinese?"", I told him no I am Malay. He started bickering about Halimah our president, asking me ""Do you agree  Halimah is a person who can only sell nasi lemak, doesn't look like a president to me"".  I asked him back ""Why Malay can't be a president?"" he started to sense that I am not keen to continue this convo... I mean what is his intention by asking me this question?

He change to another one. He asked me ""do you know what an Indian person is a good at?"" at this point I seriously have no idea what is his intention, I do hope he can shut up. This uncle is really pissing me off. I said ""no...."" (in a boring tone) of course old uncle ""thinks"" im interested.

Additionally, in the past 2 weeks i experience pain in my bottom back teeth which i suspect is an issue with my wisdom tooth. While the pain is not constant, it comes and goes a few times a day. 

For my jaw, my doctor has diagnosed me with Temporomandibular disorder and advised me to go to a dentist for further diagnosis, treatment and possibly referral to specialised institutions if the dentist deems needed. So i called up the National Healthcare Group Dental hotline to try and make an appointment. The lady on the end of the line told me that there will be no dental appointments until the dorscon level has turned green. I asked her what if i was experiencing pain and she replied she can only schedule me a meeting with a dentist if its an EMERGENCY, citing bleeding, swelling, etc. I wouldn't really consider my case an emergency per se but severe enough to affect my day to day. She also mentioned that they were also calling up patients to cancel appointments that are non urgent.

It is until this point where I have gotten quite fatigued with the overlooking of so much tasks that I can't perform my main tasks properly and often got reprimanded by supervisors due to my lack in performance.

Sometimes I try to bring up that I needed a second hand or even better, someone to take over a major responsibility from my current workload, but more often than not, I'm just greeted with a reason that they simply just couldn't find a guy or that my concerns were invalid or that everyone in the office is also suffering from the same situation (but they did not complain).

I like the work environment, just not the extra tasks/responsibilities bestowed upon me on top of my current ones. I am constantly trying to do my best, but recently I just feel that even my best isn't enough.

fkwt4d,1584564271,fkwt4d,150,,"There are lots of comments and posts about how the recent spike in infections is due to the government being ""complacent"". I don't think that's the case. Rather, I think the government is engaging in some cold-blooded, but necessary, math.

Specifically, what they are probably not saying in all their press conferences is that the math isn't just about how many people fall sick or die due to COVID-19, but balancing that with how many people will not survive economically because of the impact of the disease.

I am able to work from home. Most of my friends are too. That makes us the lucky ones. Why? Because there are billions of people around the world who work in service sectors who cannot do so, and are currently collecting unemployment, or straight up out of work. They still have to pay rent, utilities, food, etc. It is especially unfair because I work in tech, and probably have more savings as a buffer than someone who say, works as a waiter.

The reality is that shutting everything down has a cost. It's easy to say ""Oh just give everyone money to tide them over until all of this is over"". It's a harder decision to make when you expect that we won't be in the clear for up to a year.

And even if we lock down our country and shut ourselves away from the world (for 14 days, a month, 6 months, whatever), taking whatever economic hit in the process (which, by the way, is also tied to the health of our healthcare system), what do we do after? Especially when other countries are not acting as responsibly? Shut down the country until the US and Europe gets its act together? And watch our tourism industry slowly wither and die, taking thousands of people's livelihoods with it?

I'm not saying we should all be out partying. But at the same time, whatever we do, we need to accept as the new normal, and putting thousands of people out of work cannot be the new normal.

So, it's possible that the government is just ""complacent"". I think it's more likely that they know all of this, but nobody wants to hold a press conference explaining it.",,What the government is (probably) not saying about COVID-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fkwt4d/what_the_government_is_probably_not_saying_about/

Thus, I would like to ask you guys to share their ghost stories - either personal, or if you heard it from a friend of a friend, whatever! Share ghost stories (preferably local) that you've heard that chilled you to the bone, or anything that has happened to you before.

I'll start with one that really scared me (and made me super paranoid for a while, until now).

So basically, a friend of mine has a cousin who has the 'third eye'. One night, she needed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. She proceeded to head to the toilet in the kitchen to use it. As she was walking towards the toilet, she noticed from the kitchen window that a black figure was scaling the walls of the flat opposite. She lives on a higher floor, so she knew it definitely wasn't a human being. She ignored it and went about with her business.

When she came out, she looked out the window again, out of curiosity, and realized the figure was gone. At that moment, a head peeked out from the bottom part of her kitchen window and asked her in Malay, ""Eh, you saw me ah?"" She just turned and left and went back to her bedroom.

Ugh, tbh this story made me suuuuuper nervous for weeks because my kitchen window also overlooks a block opposite me.

I'd love to hear stories from you guys. Please share!",,Ghost stories - a bit of a distraction from COVID-19 news,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fy0eme/ghost_stories_a_bit_of_a_distraction_from_covid19/

g4lb4e,1587352981,g4lb4e,152,,"Recent events have made me really think hard about the quality of governance in Singapore, particularly in the areas of transparency and accountability.

The Singapore government is transparent only when it wants to be (kudos to daily covid status updates, regular press conferences, and announcements), but the operative keyphrase is ""wants to be"". We don't have freedom of information legislation, so we are kept in the dark about a lot of things (for good reason and otherwise). The recent POFMA fiasco about Ho Ching's salary has also set a clear precedent that the government can declare something as false and not have to prove it. In the past, they at least bothered to ""set the record straight"", but now it's just ""not true, but I'm not going to tell you the truth"".

In terms of accountability, we have seen how a PAP MP broke social distancing rules on a walkabout with absolutely no consequences. When a similar incident occurred in NZ, the minister was demoted publicly by the prime minister. 

Singapore had always justified its slightly-authoritarian style of governance by pointing to the inefficiencies of ""democracy rule"", and that has always held true to a certain extent. But in times of crisis, it is evident that ""messy democracies"" like Taiwan and NZ have done extremely well in handling the pandemic.

This is not a rant - it is my point of view about transparency and accountability in governance. It's also an invitation to think about what the status quo would spell for the next decades of Singapore. And regardless of whether you agree with me, I would sincerely like to hear your responses.",,Transparency and accountability in Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g4lb4e/transparency_and_accountability_in_singapore/

g0evcm,1586766183,g0evcm,155,,"Warning: This is going to be a long rant about Grabfood and Din Tai Fung (NEX) on behalf of my father who is a Grabfood delivery driver because I was so angry and upset about the events that transpired today when he told me about it. The details are recounted by him and may be biased to his experience, but it does not discount the veracity of whatever happened.

Also note: This is in no way targetted at the regular employees working at the restaurant, who were undoubtedly overworked as well. Rather, someone in the higher management has to take some responsibility and provide compensation to the drivers/riders and customers.

Update: My father informed me when I finished writing this that he received a small goodwill amount as compensation from Grab. However, I will still be posting this as I feel that this will provide good insights into the workings of the food delivery industry, and hopefully restaurants and customers will be able to empathise with riders/drivers as demand for food delivery has substantially increased, and not unfairly subject them to long waiting times or blame them for long waiting times respectively.

The Background:  My Dad who is almost 60 has been driving for Grabfood since last week as his income for PHV is no longer sustainable. This afternoon, he went on his usual lunch shift and got his first 3 stacked orders from Din Tai Fung (NEX) at around 11.30am and went to the restaurant to collect the food. When he arrived, there were already 7-8 delivery riders, who were mumbling and complaining that they had been waiting for more than 20-30 mins and that no orders had been served yet. 

The Problem:  As more and more riders arrived, it quickly became apparent that the restaurant was still very slow in handing out food to the riders/drivers. Worse, it seemed that the restaurant was prioritising orders for customers who were ordering on the spot and this led to more delivery drivers being stacked at the main entrance. Although all of them were wearing mask and observing social distancing, it was still difficult to fit all of them into proper distancing, because at one point there was almost 30 riders waiting at the entrance. (Note, most of the riders had 2-3 stacked orders, meaning that there was possibly 60-90 orders that were unfulfilled at the restaurant.) By now, the restaurant communicated to riders that orders would take upwards of 30 mins but refused to commit to a time frame as there were too many orders coming in, making it hard for riders who had to respond to customers calling to ask when their food would arrive.

Furthermore it was clear that the restaurant was struggling to cope (as the restaurant had an “open” concept, my dad could see the workers inside 
and it was clear that it was less than the usual capacity) My father would later learn that the the outlet had a promo going on and was puzzled as to why they had so little workers even when demand was bound to increase with the promo going on.

Further problems: By the one hour mark, it was clear to the restaurant and riders that the orders were not going to be resolved anytime soon, with the orders coming out 1 every 3-4 mins, and with over 20 riders still waiting. Many riders became frustrated as this was the lunch time peak hour, and staying at the restaurant only meant they could not take up other jobs, so some decided to cancel.  It was even worse for other riders who had collected other orders but not the ones at Din Tai Fung, so those orders would have turned cold. As my Dad could speak Chinese and had already collected another order, he went to check on the remaining orders and was horrified to learn that those orders had been cancelled, but the delivery status on the app remained (A few minutes ago, they were still saying they were still making, albeit the long waiting times) 

In other words, the restaurant was verbally telling delivery drivers (and only if you went up to ask them) that some of the orders would be cancelled, and that they would call the customers later. My dad told me that some other riders who did not speak Chinese were completely clueless as to what was going on and had to rely on nearby chatters to figure out the problem. They would only announce all the mass cancellations nearly 1.5 hour after the first order, and even then the app still showed the delivery status as pending.

However, as the restaurant side had not formally cancelled these orders, the customers were unable to see the cancellation and the burden fell on the delivery man to deliver the bad news, so you can quite imagine the results. My father had to explain to a customer that it was not his fault when it was implied he should not have taken a stacked order in order to maximise earnings and instead deliver just one order, when he had no idea of the situation at Din Tai Fung until he reached the restaurant. If he had knew I doubt he would have taken it as well, since the orders came together. Simply put, there was no way he could have avoided this, and once he was there he could only have cancelled the job (affecting his rating and earnings) or waited it out. And with all these going on, there was already lots of back and forth with the riders and Grab support staff, who only stopped the orders coming in after an hour of waiting time. Mind you, the riders already told Grab to stop the orders more than half an hour ago, where Grab’s response was only to call the restaurant, resulting in more unnecessary back and forth.

Conclusion: In the end, my dad could only deliver one order as the other 2 were cancelled. Although he was later compensated for the trip and given a small goodwill amount, he wasted nearly 2.5 hours in this situation, having even to go to Grab HQ (since he could not get through to Grab support staff) to troubleshoot as he could not take new orders with the old ones still pending as the restaurant had not formally cancelled them yet. This meant that he spent his entire lunch shift earning only that amount, where his usual income would be at least twice more if he had taken other jobs (And this is not even accounting for parking or other expenses). In other words, my dad earned barely enough for the 2.5 hours, and I really teared to learn he was just standing around and running around like a mad dog trying to resolve the issue with the restaurant and having to call the customers to smooth it over with them as well. I don’t understand why it is my Dad’s responsibility to inform customers about the cancellation, even if the customers were nice and understanding, there was bound to be some tension and frustration when anyone learns their food is not going to arrive after 1.5 hours.

Learning point : This incident has really made me more appreciative of delivery drivers, and I’m making it a point to tip at least a dollar to all of them in the future (I’m hoping most of you could as well), knowing that they could have very well went through what my father went through. I also appeal to the public to be understanding of delivery riders/drivers, due to the current Covid-19 situation, as many of them are former PHV or taxi drivers who are in their old age with various medical conditions. 

If you are a merchant who has come up with a promo or promo code, please be responsible enough to hire enough workers when you expect the demand to increase, and not just blindly insist on cost cutting measures.

If you are a customer who is waiting unreasonably long for your food, do check the app to see where the problem lies, and if the food is still at the merchant, please understand that the riders are every bit as frustrated as you are, and perhaps even more than you are. Since their income is dependent on the trips they make, every minute spent waiting for your food means every minute less they could be out there, taking another delivery job, affecting their overall earnings.

Also, if you are applying promo codes or ordering food on promotion, please also understand that some of the merchants may be unable to cope and that your food may take longer than usual. If you want to save on your cost, it is only expected that the delivery time would be more as there will be more orders coming in. 

Let’s all be empathetic enough to each other and be more gracious in these trying times. My dad, who despite going through all this, is still thankful that he has some earnings to cover his rental and petrol, taking home maybe $10-20 nett every day. He doesn’t feel that anyone should be blamed and that he was perhaps just unfortunate to be in this situation. I’m proud of him and all our delivery drivers still working, and we can all certainly be more appreciative towards them, instead of putting them down when your food doesn’t arrive or turns cold even if it is not their fault.",,A rant on Grabfood and Din Tai Fung (Nex),https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g0evcm/a_rant_on_grabfood_and_din_tai_fung_nex/

I no longer had to tiptoe around eggshells, nor did I ever burst into tears over toxic remarks made by my family members. I could give myself some distance while working on my issues. I was able to choose the people who were allowed into my life and new home. For awhile, my life felt okay, until the announcement of the Circuit Breaker. 


In an instant, I no longer had any physical or face to face contact with my friends and loved ones. I worked from home alone behind a laptop screen, and ate takeouts for weeks. As someone who relied on social interaction and a fixed routine to deal with my mental illness, I felt ruined by the pandemic. 


I didn't leave the house, let alone my bed. Empty shelves in the supermarket meant that I survived mainly on frozen snacks. I stopped taking my antidepressants. I no longer took care of my personal hygiene. Trash and dishes piled up while I began to break down. Work became even more overwhelming than usual, and my isolation felt suffocating. 


I was aware that I could leave my house at any time to take a walk, to take a deep breath and comfort myself. As many apathetic people would tell me, ""Just stop thinking about the negative!"". But leaving the house was a goal that was too far away. Taking a step outside felt too exhausting, too much for me to handle. Leaving the house still meant that I'll be alone. I would never be able run into the arms of my loved ones. After all, we're not allowed to interact with anyone outside, and I was also 30km away from them. News broke that a relative of mine had committed suicide. No funeral or proper goodbyes could be held. 


Extensions of the circuit breaker and discussions on how long it'll take before life could get back to normal made it hard for me to breathe. Normalcy is all I hoped for, and hope was fading. I felt driven over the edge. I still am. 


Prior to the circuit breaker, I spent years in therapy. I made really good progress, and was told that I could finally graduate from my therapist at the start of this year. The pandemic left me with loose ends regarding my therapy, my relationship with my family, and progression in my life.


I can empathize with online videos on social media of people throwing furniture off buildings, of people making a scene in public.

I felt angry over everyone and every country which played a part in the spread of the virus. I felt frustration over the changes I was forced to endure. 


Isolation felt like a personal attack towards me. Logic told me that I was being ridiculous, but depression told me that everything that has happened was done on purpose because I didn't deserve love and social interaction. I didn't deserve the normalcy that I desperately wanted. I am not allowed to be happy. I am not permitted good things in my life. I believe that had I not have gone through therapy, I would have already fallen apart.


To end this off, here are some of the things I've done to keep myself sane:

- Forcing myself to take a shower

 Taking a shower regularly gives me a push to take care of other parts of myself, such as skincare and dental hygiene. Rather than just showers, the more accurate term would be to create a list of 'bare minimums'. I can spend my day doing nothing, but I must at least complete my 'bare minimums' such as taking a shower, eating breakfast and taking my pills.


- Befriending myself

 Like the movie ""Inside Out"", I envision my feelings as individual components of who I am. My sadness and anger often dominates my mind, but I remind myself that these are just emotions inside of me, and not who I am as a person. I don't have to act how they want me to, I just have to acknowledge that these feelings exists.


- Mothering myself

 Similar to befriending myself, I remind myself to be kind. I am understanding of my problems, and acknowledge its existence. I am patient towards myself and celebrate small achievements like getting myself out of bed. Like a mother towards a child, I only want the best for myself, and will encourage myself gently.


- Don't suppress your emotions

 Even if you're afraid of rejection, speak to someone you trust or go to an anonymous public platform to share your thoughts and mental state. Being vulnerable opens up conversations, and may provide you with support. Writing is something that I've always found cathartic, and was also a method my therapist encouraged me to do.


Everyone is having a tough time during the pandemic. This is a known fact. You're not alone if you have depressive symptoms. It is okay to not come out of circuit breaker mastering new languages or having a summer-ready body. Those are privileges that not everyone can afford. 


Depression is equivalent to the common cold, in the realm of mental disorders. Job loss, grief, and social isolation are events that many face, and its okay to not feel okay. It is okay to be anxious and cry. But for the sake of your own mental well-being, for the sake of what is best for yourself, please keep moving no matter how paralyzing or meaningless it may feel.

I wrote this mainly to share how i've been coping with the circuit breaker, and to jot down all the thoughts that have been intruding my mind. These are things that i've been wanting to say to my boss, to my family and my friends. I try not to share my feelings with them in-depth because I don't want to cause unnecessary worry or panic. I'm more or less stable, just that it takes me time to get a hold of myself.

This is the first General Election since 1984 where is have watched it from the side-lines. I was actively involved in every GE since 1984, either as a PAP activist or as a candidate from 1996 to 2011 and then as the Prime Minister’s principal election agent in 2015. Watching from the side-lines, this give me the opportunity to observed and understand the issues that Singaporeans are concerned with and how they decided to vote. I am sharing my views, some may agree some may not, but these are my personal views.

It is a long analysis, so I will do a 2-part post for ease of reading. I have broken the 2 parts as follows.

Part 1 – Why this was a watershed election, how Singaporeans voted and how the campaign style affected voters.

Part 2 – The deeper issues that PAP and the opposition face and the way forward for the PAP.

Enjoy the read.

GE2020 – A Watershed Election

Singaporeans woke up to a new reality on 11 July 2020, after what one can consider a watershed general election. Did the PAP get the mandate they were seeking? If not, what went wrong? This was supposed to be an important GE with the PAP seeking an endorsement of the 4G leaders who are supposed to take over the leadership for the next lap of Singapore’s progress. What message have Singaporean voters delivered to the government and to the nation?

Let me start by analysing the results. GE2020 does not demonstrate the lowest support for the PAP. GE2015 could be considered an anomaly as Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s death weighed heavily on voters’ hearts and sentiments as he was our founding father who had raised Singapore to such a high calibre. Comparing GE2011 to GE2020, at this GE, the PAP saw a 1% improvement over GE2011. But can this 1% increase over 2011 be considered a real improvement? Singaporeans need to ask ourselves – is this 1% improvement over 2011 good enough considering that the odds were stacked against the opposition in this GE and typically when the PAP calls for an election in moments of crisis as it did in 2001, they tend to do very well. Further, there were 4 budgets rolled out to help Singaporeans just before this GE.

Well, there are definitely some major shifts that have happened, and some clear signals Singaporeans are giving, and it is important that PAP must understand what these are, for the sake of PAP’s and Singapore’s future.

If we look closely, there is a now a clear distinction among the opposition parties. The WP garnered more than 50% of votes where they stood, and the PSP got 41% while the SDP was next with 37%. And the rest of the parties garnered between 20% to 37% of votes where there competed. So had the top 3 opposition parties competed in all the constituencies in Singapore, the PAP national average would have decreased to less than 55% which we can consider a danger zone of losing power in later years. Singaporeans are now clearly making a distinction and showing which parties they consider credible and reliable and are willing to vote for.

Marine Parade perhaps reflects the true sentiments of Singaporeans. The PAP’s candidates demonstrated great promise and seemed better qualified than the WP candidates. However, they could only garner 57%, against a relatively unknown WP team. Why is this so. I believe that the WP has today gained the reputation that PAP has had all these years. They have gained a brand recognition as a reputable and responsible political party. I will explain this in the 2nd part of my post.

Let me start by sharing my assessment of how Singaporeans voted at GE2020.

How Different Segments Voted

The older voters especially the pioneer generation, who probably make up 400,000 of the voters, mostly voted for the PAP (likely about 80% to 90% of them). They are grateful to the government for transforming their lives in the early years and bringing them from third world to first world in their lifetime. And the icing on the cake for them was the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) which greatly helps them in retirement. Individuals like my mother will never vote against the PAP.

The heartlanders, mainly those from the smaller HDB flats would have mostly voted for the PAP. They are mainly concerned with bread and butter issues and they received significant financial support from the government in the months leading up to the GE, through the 4 super budgets. I believe 70% to 80% of them voted for the PAP. I speak regularly with some of these fellow Singaporeans and had a sense that they are happy about the help they got and were likely to vote for PAP. The opposition also faced difficulty in reaching out to these individuals because of the restrictions of campaigning, especially not having physical rallies. Heartlanders were swayed by all the support they got during this pandemic. If not for this, I don't think PAP would have gotten even the 61%. So, the timing of this GE during a Pandemic and the campaign rules were also to the PAP advantage because the heartlanders can be engaged better via physical rallies.

The group that likely mostly voted against the PAP were the young voters, especially the millennials. They want to have diversity of views; they want more contestation of ideas and are not content with one party just pushing their policies without enough debate. They want to be more involved and don’t accept the bureaucratic style of the PAP government.

The social media had great influence on them. Although the campaign rules did not allow physical rallies, the opposition made very good use of the social media and online rallies to get their messages through and these resonated with the young voters. The PAP online campaign was lacking, and it did not help that many PAP friendly sites who are likely PAP IBs were hitting below the belt and resorted to character assassination instead of having an intellectual argument of ideas and policies. Sentiments expressed among this group online reveal that they disagreed with what some have called “gutter politics”. The younger voters appeared to be displeased with the PAP styles of campaigning. Another factor was the quality of candidates in the opposition that many of the younger voters could relate with. I will elaborate on both later. I believe more than 50% of the young voted for the opposition this time.

The biggest group I feel that made the difference this time are the middle income, middle aged - THE SANDWICHED CLASS. They were the swing voters. These are educated Singaporeans, who are social media savvy. Many PMETs fall into this category and this was the group that the PAP failed to attract. Many are underemployed, some in the gig economy because they can't find relevant jobs. They are worried about their jobs and about foreigners taking away their jobs and their children’s' future. The PAP could not completely convince them that they have ideas on how to create the future jobs although they made job creation their main agenda. The PAP talked about the ""what"" but could not convince Singaporeans on the ""how"" - How will the good jobs come about? For example, the CFE was not at all convincing about the future economy and left many questions unanswered about job creation which calls into question the 4G team’s ability to lead Singapore. While they did not completely revolt and vote against the PAP, they were also the ones who were willing to vote for the better candidates and the more established parties like WP, PSP and the SDP. But they are informed voters and did not vote blindly for any opposition candidates. In areas where weaker opposition parties were fielded, they still voted for the PAP.

Campaign Style

Some have observed that the PAP’s campaign style was similar to that of the 1980s and 1990s. Many have frowned upon personal attacks, name calling and character assassination. Further, police investigations, and POFMA also appeared to rile voters up. On the other hand, some observers noted that the opposition was more gentlemanly in their campaign than the PAP this time. While the PAP had to deal with the issue arising from Ivan Lim’s suitability as a candidate, this did not appear to have been initiated by any political party. The opposition camps focused on attacking policies and not individuals which individuals perceived the PAP did. I think it is clear that Singaporeans are saying that it’s time to show magnanimity and focus on issues and constructive criticism.

The young voters were especially agitated by Raeesah Khan being hit with a sledgehammer. The young voters were disappointed by the PAP’s approach Forcing WP to declare their views on Khan were perceived as bullish which did not go down well with not just younger voters but even older voters who want to see a more compassionate PAP. In fact, many feel that what tipped the scales in Sengkang was the treatment of Raeesah Khan rather than Jamus Lim’s popularity.

This style of politics is outdated, and opposition members should not be viewed as enemies especially when we, as a nation, are plagued with the same concern - making Singapore competitive again. Contestation of ideas should have been the priority and not contestation among individuals.

One big issue for the PAP campaign this GE is that it lacked focus on their manifesto. They got caught up firefighting on issues raised by the opposition – the 10m population, the handling of the Covid-19 by the government (the comments Paul Tambyah made on the handling of the dorm issues), focused on discrediting individuals on the opposition camp rather than discrediting their manifestos. It would have been more useful for the PAP leaders to use reason to convince Singaporeans of how the plans in their manifesto were superior compared to the plans presented by the opposition.

This GE also showed how spending time on ground is essential not just during the GE but also in the years leading up to it. In this respect, it is understandable why PSP did not win a single seat – they are a nascent party which did not have the opportunity to walk the ground and engage voters early. The circuit breaker did not help, and the lack of physical rallies was a great disadvantage for all opposition parties. So, the incumbent candidates who have been on the ground performed better compared to the new candidates for both the PAP and WP.

Having understood how Singaporeans voted, it is useful to understand the deeper rooted issues that showed up in GE2020 that have very long term implications for the politics of Singapore and it is a the peril of the PAP and the opposition leaders if they fail to understand and address these issues.

We have to face the facts, COVID-19 isn't going to magically disappear unless we take drastic measures. The only effective way to combat COVID-19 in its accelerating phase is to isolate everyone from each other, it has been proven in Italy and China where their curve is slowly flattening. 

This is a extremely unpopular opinion in this sub, but I will still say it: The only reasons you should leave your house are: You're working an essential job, you need groceries/food, you need medical help. The crowding at wet markets and supermarkets is understandable, given that we all need food to sustain ourselves. Some measures that we can take to reduce congestion at markets:  

* Boosting grocery delivering services (or making it free altogether)
* Mindset shift of people who cook to shift towards simple foods that can last long (E.g. frozen meat &amp; veg, pasta, canned food, pasteurized eggs)
* Doing an Italy and limiting grocery runs per household
* Helping wet markets set up delivery orders

If it's still not clear after reading the above, maybe we should take a look at some case studies.

Allowing people to exercise has resulted in the opposite effect from preventing people from gathering. Suddenly everyone is a marathon runner and heading to parks to run. Regular joggers have mentioned that they've seen a sharp increase in unfamiliar faces in parks, also families with kids and elderly strolling around.

The official reason was to ""protect the elderly"", but I'm sure it's pretty obvious what caused the crackdown on this. Non-essential workers who can't handle their own kids (i'm not saying it's easy to handle kids while working but there are parents who can handle it well) that abused the system, now essential workers with kids have to suffer at the hands of irresponsible non-essential workers.

I am a Danish guy living in Denmark. I started a master's program back in September and in my class is a guy from Singapore, who has quickly become a good friend.

I must admit I don't know much about Singaporean cuisine and honestly, while I consider myself a decent cook, I'm not very practised in cooking Asian food at all. Also, I keep a pescetarian diet which might complicate things.

I was hoping you could help me with suggestions on what to cook so that I could make something that is an authentic Singaporean meal, pescetarian/vegetarian, not too hard for someone who does not have a lot of experience with cooking Asian food (though I am definitely willing to do some practise runs), and preferably is somewhat a comfort food. Copenhagen has a decent amount of Asian food markets so I should be able to get ingredients as long as they are not too esoteric.

I would really appreciate your help in finding something to cook for my friend, since he was not able to go back home this summer. I know it likely will not taste completely authentic (when made by a Dane), but I think he would really appreciate the gesture.

I appreciate our reliable public utilities infrastructure. The ability to drink out of the tap is not a privilege many countries have.

I appreciate our world class medical services. Getting sick is tough. Navigating through a pandemic is even tougher. But our frontliners have been doing an amazing job so far - it gives me the confidence that we can ride through the storm.

I appreciate the opportunity to travel to so many countries easily. Our country is strategically connected to the world, and our passport is very imba.

I appreciate the choice to lim kopi and eat caipng downstairs, but also access renowned restaurants and bars if I'm feeling fancy.

I appreciate the mutual respect we have for each other's religions and rituals.

I appreciate that I feel safe enough to walk back home at midnight alone. Also, the two times I've lost my wallet, it was returned to me with every cent intact - that's really amazing.

The prescribed exceptions include leaving one’s ordinary place of residence to “*procure any goods or services from an essential service provider or a specified school*”, so this means you can still leave the house to purchase food etc. The full list of prescribed exceptions is set out at regulation 4(3).

When we had a class party (in school that was regulated by teachers causer we were 12) I distinctly remember walking up and down along the parade square, while everyone was enjoying themselves cause no one invited to be part of their group.

Yesterday, since it was a day before the ""term break"", I decided to go out with my friends for lunch, the first time since CB started. It was over lunch I realised that while I didn't have a single best friend, this group of friends were made me feel welcomed and accepted when I am with them. 

Later on, they even got me a super expensive gift at a store at the mall we were eating for my bday. Everyone always says ""it's the heart that counts"" but yet, they still chose to fork up the money and give me such an expensive gift, and it touched me.

Then I was hit with that classic English composition realisation moment.

My friends truly cared for me. They really do. All this while I've been focusing on the time that I'm alone when u should be focusing on the times we had fun together. I also never actually appreciated all their efforts to help me out or just 陪伴 (accompany) me.

Same thing back in primary school. My friends truly cared about me, but I never realised or noticed it. I shut people out apparently, not the other way around.

Now that I'm 14 and a big boy (ahahaha I can feel the cringe) , I hope I can learn to be more appreciative of my friends as well as everything around me.

euvdoy,1580162918,euvdoy,214,,"Recently, I have noticed a lot of people politicising the decisions being made by the government with regards to travel restrictions (or lack there-of). I think there are a few things we should keep in mind before rushing to blame the government.

* MPs are not infectious disease experts. Realistically, they should not be making decisions based on their own gut feeling or on people's chatter. Instead of prescribing solutions, we should be trying to make sure that they are taking into account advice from experts in epidemiology, such as those in MOH who are probably (hopefully) advising the government on the response.
* Travel bans do not reduce the eventual number that will be infected; at best, they would simply slow down the amount of time taken to get there. [Health experts do not consider it to be a wise policy.](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/23/21078325/wuhan-china-coronavirus-travel-ban) Unless you have a leak-proof travel ban, for a virus with a R0 of \~1.8-3 (current estimates iirc), it'll still spread life wildfire as soon as a single infectious individual is imported. Singapore is not even self-sufficient in the short-term, so that is not a helpful strategy. It is much more important to have policies that reduce the [effective reproduction number](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/mathematical-models~mathematical-models-models.htm~mathematical-models-2.2.htm). If the R0 is 3, to prevent the disease from sustaining itself in the local population we would need to prevent more than 2/3rds of transmissions. If this is done successfully, the disease would not spread very far locally; if it isn't, as soon as one infected individual gets through the travel ban we're fucked anyway. Even if you have a travel ban against all of China (not feasible due to dependence on imports), non-Chinese-citizens can likely still get through by taking a series of roundabout transfers. Let's be real, if Singapore residents who consider Singapore to be home are stuck in China they'd definitely be trying to get back to their home and jobs. You'd likely make it worse because now MOH wouldn't know who to keep tabs on. The fact that there does not seem to be sustained transmission locally suggests that the effective reproduction number is being kept below 1.
* Even if you don't believe me, listen to [the WHO](https://www.who.int/ith/2020-24-01-outbreak-of-Pneumonia-caused-by-new-coronavirus/en/): 

&gt;With the information currently available for the novel  coronavirus, WHO advises that measures to limit the risk of exportation  or importation of the disease should be implemented, without unnecessary  restrictions of international traffic. 

* I obviously don't know what is going on in the heads of the Chinese leadership when they implemented a travel ban despite what epidemiology and public health experts are saying. If I had to speculate, however, I'd imagine that the provincial and municipal government tried to cover up initially (as usual), and now the central government is trying to save face by overreacting.",,Travel bans and kneejerk policymaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/euvdoy/travel_bans_and_kneejerk_policymaking/

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;TLDR: SPH reporter post fake news.

I have COVID-19. A story was made up about my illness for a national newspaper.Like other Singaporeans who have caught the virus, I have used Instagram stories to document my journey to recovery. Yet unlike other Singaporeans, my journey has been unnecessarily bumpy.*As a disclaimer, before I elaborate on anything else, I would like to firmly state that my intentions of sharing my stories on Instagram were to reassure my parents and friends that I am recovering well, and am in the good hands of the State as we take a multi-pronged approach to tackle this pandemic.*

Unfortunately, my Instagram stories were picked up by a Lianhe Zaobao/Wanbao (LHZB/LHWB) reporter and our subsequent interactions led to much distress and anxiety on top of the discomfort and pain I experienced while recovering from COVID-19.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **National Newspaper fabricates interview based on my COVID-19 experience.**

Lianhe Zaobao published an article online, ""阻断措施期间足不出户 南大生不解为何染疫"", roughly translated to \*""NTU Student Gets COVID-19 even though he stayed home during the CB Period"".\****This is misleading because it suggests and perpetuates the idea that people can get COVID-19 even if they stay home.*** The clickbait nature of the headline which merely **unsettles public confidence** when reassurance is most needed.

Given that LHZB/LHWB’s main audience are the older folks, imagine the kind of paranoia that might ensue for those who take the headline on face value, and that is extremely irresponsible of LHZB/LHWB, \*especially in these times of heightened anxiety.\*

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **Journalist sought consent, but was rejected.**

On 1 May 2020, a journalist from SPH, “James” (*Name changed to prevent doxxing*), approached me on Instagram through his Instagram account. “James” sought my consent to use photographs which I had taken and uploaded to my Instagram stories, meant to be up for 24hrs on the account, @ &lt;REMOVED FOR REDDIT&gt;. I stated categorically to “James” that I do not consent to the use of my photographs or any of my personal information relating to my experience.

“James” **acknowledged** my refusal of consent. It is even more damning that he recognised my refusal but still went behind my back to use my content to fabricate his story.

Despite my clear refusal to give consent, “James” went ahead and used my photographs and details of my experience, including my personal information, in a Lianhe Zaobao article dated 7 May 2020, with the title “阻断措施期间足不出户 南大生不解为何染疫"". In that article, “James” also claimed that he interviewed me. This statement is patently false.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** **Friend’s dad was able to identify I that the article was referring to me.**

I was mortified when I found out about the article on 7 May 2020, at around 1515hours through a friend. Her dad had seen the article, and from the profile of the interviewee, he could deduce that the journalist was writing about me. This highlights how easy it was to identify me. A check with NTU also confirmed that I was the only 25-year-old male NTU student with COVID-19.

**4.** **“James” created a fictional picture of me, with the content on IG Stories**Going further than rejecting my initial refusal of ‘No’, “James” went to the extent of building up a fictional picture of me.“James” had used my content I posted on Instagram Stories, as a basis to make up an entire story including personal details on my family, my daily activities prior to the CB period, during the CB period, these were FALSE.At this point, I am certain that “James” has crossed the lines of Ethical Journalism. “James’” conduct is a gross and serious violation of fundamental journalistic ethics.I later called out the journalist on my Instagram Story, and LHWB’s Facebook page in order to raise my concerns over the false reporting and illegal use of my photos.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Journalist was aware that I had found out about the article.**

\*The journalist reached out to me on 7th May 2020, at 1722. “James” referred to it as a “misunderstanding”, which is frankly ridiculous, as I had clearly said “NO”. I refuse to believe that SPH Journalists do not understand what “No” means.

Later that night, Lianhe Zaobao changed the article’s photo to a generic D'Resort image. However, the journalist’s work of fiction remained up.

&amp;#x200B;

**6.** **Reached out to editors. However, issues raised were not acknowledged**

I then reached out to editors in LHZB/LHWB, to highlight this issue.

The response was that : After an internal investigation, they found out that “James” had *written the story based on my social media postings, and had made a wrong judgment to mention that I was interviewed although I had refused to.*

However, this disregards the fact that “James” had fabricated his own fictional work. The only things I have posted were about how I felt of my stay at EXPO and had since been moved to D'Resort. The article mentioned my family, my daily activities prior to being admitted to the hospital, where I lived, whether I went out during the Circuit Breaker Period. These are all FALSE information.

Ethical journalism should be accurate and fair. Journalists should be honest and courageous in gathering, reporting, and interpreting information. Yet, from what “James” did, his fabricated tales have caused panic.

&amp;#x200B;

**7.** **Article caused unnecessary panic.**

Although the online article has since been taken down, the printed version remains in the community.The untruthful reporting within the article that LHZB/LHWB has published online (and offline) has impacted the wider community. This can be seen on various online communities:

1. Causing unnecessary panic amongst the NTU Community (as seen from NTU Confessions)
2. LHZB/LHWB Facebook posts which are now deleted, netizens who reposted the story speculated that even staying home is dangerous.
3. Foreign news sites have also picked up on the story, even though it is not a factual story.(As of **11 May 2020 2030,** the story is still online.)

This story basically used my identity and my COVID-19 experiences to cook up an article that caused panic, and at the same time monetised by LHWB/LHZB.

&amp;#x200B;

**8.** **Emotional and psychological distress.**

I think no one is able to comprehend the shock I felt when I saw my own story being published on the news like that. I have been dealing with COVID-19, and not disclosing much about my experience to anybody because I wanted to avoid the attention, and avoid dramatising/sensationalising the virus.

Yet, I woke up from my rest to see my own pictures and experiences being circulated via the media, without my consent. It felt like a true betrayal of trust. I have also been on the receiving end of many of the hateful/blunt comments by various netizens speculating that I might have been untruthful and non-compliant to Contact Tracing and Circuit Breaker measures.

This adds on to the unnecessary stress that comes with trying to recover from COVID-19, being away from my family and friends for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

**9.** **Combatting Fake News**

*At this juncture, I refer to a quote by Mr Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of Bangladesh’s The Daily Star: “In order to combat the onslaught of fake news, news organisations have to be diligent, uphold ethics and better engage readers to maintain public confidence in what they publish..... Until we do that, fake news is going to haunt us."" - ST*

Not only did “James” make up this entire piece of fictional work. It is troubling that he chose to use it as a vehicle to sensationalise the COVID-19 situation with such a headline. I strongly believe that news must be factual, impartial, and accurate.

The Straits Times’ political editor, Zakir Hussain, also mentioned that news organizations should call out ""false and insidious"" reports they might otherwise have downplayed, debunk fake news and its agenda, and help educate readers to spot falsehoods and correct disinformation. Isn’t that what the Government has been championing for the past few months, especially with the introduction of POFMA?

How LHZB/LHWB handled the situation, of just deleting the posts and article without a retraction, apology, or clarification of the news is really irresponsible.

In these times where we need a strong united front (#SGUnited) to tackle a crisis, I sincerely hope that all news outlets report accurately and factually, without misleading or fear-mongering headlines and content.

Journalists need to be careful about how they conduct themselves in these times, the people rely on them for factual information, not non-existent interviews and made up facts which sow fear and paranoia in the community.

Today, I am going to go out on a limb and predict once again that we will see another huge spike 2 weeks from now. Circuit breaker will be extended beyond the 1 month, or it might get solidified into a full lockdown. 

# Why? 

Just take a look at the crowds we had at Ikea, supermarkets, popular and even Toys“R”Us (Really? toys are essential?). The best method to fight this invisible enemy is to avoid crowds, 1 infected person can potentially spread it to a large crowd. 

Take a leaf out of some of the badly hit countries (I'm using examples of mass gatherings, but you can see the point - Every gathering, big or small helps the invisible enemy spread its wings):

# Circuit breaker relies on trusting Singaporeans to do the right things

The circuit breaker acts as a guideline to urge Singaporeans to stay at home, but can we really trust people to follow this guideline? Just today, coffeeshops were crowded with people drinking beer, casually chatting. Void decks were filled with youngsters loitering. People taking the past 2 days as the ""last chance"" to meet friends and go out to have fun. 

What will change in the weeks to come? Yes, non-essential shops will close, hawker centers will be takeaway only. But what's to stop people who choose to have gatherings in houses, void decks or public spaces? What's to stop people from takeaway-ing only to gather somewhere else to eat? 

Singaporeans are not taking this seriously enough. If they were, then we wouldn't see people heading out for leisure in the past 2 days. 

Let's take a look at populations that didn't take it seriously:

* [Beachgoers in the US](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-governor-refuses-shut-down-beaches-amid-spread-coronavirus-n1162226), now they have **330,379** cases

* [Just 5 days ago in New York City](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fseld1/nyc_is_taking_this_seriously_look_at_this_crowd/) they had [48,575](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_New_York_City#Data) cases then, now they have [122,031](https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-DailyTracker?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n) cases

As long as there's a portion of people who don't take it seriously, the invisible enemy will win.

1. How can you tell if someone removes the battery or the battery is drained or maybe it's damaged (I can't tell if the battery is removable since I don't have it). Although the device emits a blinking light every min. Do you really expect the person to stand there waiting for it to blink and say ok it's working! Move on next? If not, it effectively renders the device and whole system useless since you can't prove you have a working device.
2. What's the point of having a dual system of having to scan QR code + tracetogether? Does that mean they expected TT to have such a high failure rate it couldn't relace safeentry? I mean do you really need to know where everyone been to if you already know who they hanging out with at which time? 
3. The cost. The battery life is expected to last 6 months and non-rechargeable. I don't have the token, so i can't tell if it's replaceable. But if it's not. At 20 dollars per pcs and assuming half the population gotten 1. That's 60,000,000 SGD / 6 months, not including the cost of distribution, manpower, shipping etc. We haven't take into account recall, hardware failure.
4. The initial targeted audience of the nontech savvy elderly likely struggle to operate anything not to say figure if the token is working or not and get it replaced when needed. 
5. The whole compulsory things feel like someone trying to hit short term KPI without thinking of the overall system, implementation, and long term plan.

**Timeline of events that followed**

* 1pm Overdose of planned toxic substance, 8 times or more the lethal amount
* 15\~30 mins later, body begun violently vomiting. Locked myself in toliet
* 4pm, plan seems to have gone wrong. No planned heart attack. Wanted to call ambulance, but I was determined to go through. Or somehow stable down before someone comes home, so I can treat it as nothing happened.
* 7pm, still conscious and blood in vomit. Family returned, but tried to get me to unlock the door. 8pm, I finally gave in and open it with my last strength. Didn't want to go GP cause I know its helpless but didn't want to say I committed suicide, so I said nothing. Ambulance arrived and somehow everyone thinks I had food poisoning from pizza the night before. Actually, that was my last meal. I just wanted to have one with the family before I go thru with the plan.
* 1am already, medications given somehow made the body super cold with non stop shivering. Sent to special observation area, waiting for a bed. While being pumped with potassium IV drip cause electrolytes from blood test were all messed up. This IV drip hurts like fk, like you stabbed your hand with a pen. Doctors seems confused, so I confessed. It's time to save me if I can't die. I thought they would pump my stomach but they seems clueless at what I was asking. Given more drip, and another new vomit bag cause the retching  wouldn't stop. Stomach seems empty at this point but I can still taste the toxic substance in my saliva and the body was rejecting it hard. One staff told another staff. ""I googled it but seems nothing much, I guess we just keep hydrating him then."" At this moment, I wondered if I should have asked to go SGH instead of CGH. Also, was given a catheter in my dick cause I could not pee into the urinal. Lots of brown urine started flowing out, bag filled fast.
* 10am, still no hope. More IV drip for hydration and vomit medication injected through some plug in the hand. Still vomiting an empty stomach and spitting saliva out, no sleep through the night. The stuff I took had an energy effect and it was keeping me super awake despite my body feeling like it desperately needs a sleep. Could not lie down, instant vomit feel. Have to sit out and try to force out whatever I was trying to vomit from my empty stomach. I could feel something but somehow could not vomit out from  a sitting angle. Asked to go to the toilet to vomit but was rejected due to fall risk. Asked to see doctor, that I feel I have a stomach in my hole. No doctor came, and passing doctors just say they are not my doctor. Finally someone looked at me but his not my doctor? He checked my stomach for fluid then left... that's it. I thought I was dead. Asked for Charcoal pill but was kept waiting. Pressed bed bell but no nurse would come. Well, they did eventually but very long wait. Telemetry device was tapped to my body, I learnt later that this connects wireless to the ICU. But this device is funny, they keep having to change battery cause it keeps losing connection and wouldn't turn on.
* 4pm, I think? No sleep yet. Still retching and more new vomit bags. Wiping with tissue paper at this point had cause the skin on nose, the lip and around it to peel with dryness. No choice, have to keep wiping still. The nose was filling with mucus, I had to clear it so I can breath. But finally breathing difficulty set in and they gave me oxygen. But BP machine shows oxygen at 100%.
* 9pm, nurses shift my bed to another area in front of the nurse counter so they could monitor me. Now I feel bad for the patients there, cause I'm still splitting saliva and retching into my vomit bag every 3\~5 mins. Throat at this time was sore, and there were some blood in my spit. Nobody cared when I told them, and I haven't seen any doctor. More IV drips and vomiting medicine injected through the plug in my hand.

**Fast Forward, the serious moment**

* 25th March, I have finally seen the doctor for the first time, I think? Pretty Chinese Female. Was told I'm given 2 very powerful medication already but my body is reacting severely to what I ovedosed on. The psychiatrist wanted to talk but I was vomitting/retching. Been like this, non-stop since admission. Still on IV drip, with plugs on both hands now. My elbow skin had peeled from holding the vomit bag non-stop and rubbing against the blanket. It hurts. No sleep yet, since the suicide. Was placed on adult diaper caused I shitted in my pants, bowel control seems lost at this point.
* Late afternoon, seems to have choked on the charcoal pill in my throat. Stuck feeling but warm water didn't seems to help and I was not allowed to eat or drink cause I was still retching. Relative who visited said my throat was swollen that's likely why I feel something. No need to take x-ray.  Not really convinced but whatever. Everything was so uncomfortable. Even the breathing tube, I removed it multiple times cause it was blowing wind into my stomach? 
* I begun losing control of my limbs, only have control of 1 and a half hand? Have to will myself, eyes started doing random stuff like raising the eyebrows one by one, legs were moving up and down by itself. Doctor visited in evening, and I said I am having some random bout of OCD. That the body didn't feel like it was mine anymore. Not very sure what doctor said, but I think I was given another (third?) powerful drug for the vomiting. All I can remember at this point was, they have taken tons of blood and poked me many times cause they keep failing to draw the blood, cause it keeps drying out. Sometime at 10pm, I begun losing consciousness. I wanted to sleep and I could feel like I could finally get some sleep in such a long time, but there was a voice in my head. Someone in my voice was talking to me directly, but I am not sure why I referred to it as the devil. (I'm a free thinker) But it was laughing at me for not treasuring my life and now its going to take over it and give it back when its done. It was running crazy suggestions through my mind like throwing my diaper to the window and screaming ""Covid19 HAHAHA!"" then trying to have sex with the nurse, and the cars in the distant carpark which I can see through the window was somehow also sexualised. It's like the horny side of me which I have suppressed all the time was breaking through and this side is now taking over. I dare not sleep, the voice said and I knew that if I sleep, it could take over and ruin my life. I did not want to wake up tied down or sent to jail. I even had the though for taking the respirator off the patient in my opposite bed. Started sticking tongue out, licking randomly as if I was licking \*cough\* a girl. I dunno why, it's just like this, then I begun bitting my tongue as if trying to bite it off. Tried stopping it while keeping awake but ultimately lost, and lost conscious.
* 2am, next day. I woke up in some sort of stroke mode. Repeating words like where I am, what is this, who am I, then forcing myself to shut up so I don't disturb others and that I need to shut up so I can sleep. I need to sleep, I told myself. Went in and out of this state a few times, then finally went into a vegetable state. Strange feeling of being stuck in the body, unable to move and filled with all kind of ridiculously sex thoughts. I think I was ejaculating into the urinal bag at this time, I'm not too sure. I used my last strength to tell the nurse to please kill me, I don't know what is wrong with my body. I can sign, I sign well, please burn me. Let me die and I just keep repeating something like this. I didn't want to be stuck in a vegetable mode. My whole mind was fked at this time with sex sex sex. I couldn't move, I didn't know if I can die, I prayed to the lord to save me, take me away. I can't do anything. I needed to die. I hoped that necrosis set in and finally set in. Somehow I could still think from a 3rd person perspective. Then I died. It was just like sleep, I didn't feel anything... I was just gone. Gone, no pain... no nothing. Just gone.
* 10am, 26th March morning, I woke up super confused. I was not tied up, I was still alive. The retching had stopped and I finally got some sleep? My first thought was, was the devil done with my life? It did said it would give back to me once it was done with it, and ruined me but it didn't said when. But what happened while I was gone? I don't know, I have some bits of memories but they were not making sense. It feels like I had leaped through time horizontally into another separate timeline. The patient next to my bed was the first to ask me, ""Are you okay now?"" That's when I realized, I had stopped vomitting/retching/spitting saliva. I survived, I'm okay? I wondered what's the organ damage while I was given more IV drip and injected medication. The social worker and psychiatrist finally talked to me and I learnt that I had a seizure attack. That Creatine Kinase was spiking super high in my blood and I have suffered muscle breakdown from the overdose. My liver was inflamed, and I was finally given something to eat. Liquid soup however for the day. 
* 7am, 27th March morning. I got some sleep, I seemed fine now. Better, I guess but still on diaper. However I have regained all limbs control and the brain feels somewhat lagging but I was still me and I could think. I wanted to see the doctor and understand the damage to my body, but somehow didn't have the chance. Doctor saw me and immediately talked about IMH transfer which sunk my heart. I knew suicide was a crime in Singapore and that means, I now have to pay the price. CGH was also super quick to transfer me to IMH and I was gone by 1pm. *(If staff from CGH is reading this, know that I'm upset that I was not completely recovered first before I was transferred to IMH. But I appreciate the ward upgrade and nurses that went above to help me. Especially the showering and diaper change, and my spamming of the bed bell button. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, for each and everyone. One was especially nice to me but I didn't get your name, sorry)*

This post was longer than I expected, but ultimately I was warded in IMH for another 12 days and they were very confused why someone who was suicidal with the determination to do it 100% certain death, will now be cheerful that his alive. The IMH experience was however super horrible, though some parts of it was great. The nurses, most of them except a few... were super nice to me. However that's probably a separate post as this is too long. It's a fun experience though, being sent to general ward (C class) where all the crazy people are there, fighting and ppl tied up in a ward with 40+ beds and 10 beds per cluster. 4 on each sides of the wall/divider and 2 in the middle. It's like a pandemic situation in India in some haunted hospital where toilet paper and hand soap doesn't exist.

Ultimately, I wanted to share this in hopes that this would give an idea to anyone who wanted to commit suicide. The choice is still ultimately choice but know that its a horrible experience when you are stuck in a situation where you can't die, and can't be saved either. And then ultimately having your freedom stolen for your own safety, cause suicide is a crime. Even though it has been decriminalized recently, the mental act is still enacted. IMH is one messed up place too, there is so much they need to improve. It's weird that the government is encouraging no prejudice or discrimination against ppl with mental problems, but in IMH... you are constantly doubted and your self worth destroyed. They know what's good for you, and you don't know what's good for you is the best way to describe it. 

# Afterthoughts

I hope this post was useful and although I'm glad to be alive and discharged from IMH yesterday. It's kinda weird to have to live life again and somehow life seems weirder now. As if it begun after I woke up in the hospital rather than a continuation of life before the suicide. And somehow I missed my  interactions with the hospital staffs and patients. I feel more lonely now, after discharged. Not being able to interact with new people, face to face and sharing life stories, helping each other and giving advice. I guess, I really missed interacting with people. I plan to use the computer lesser and leave the online world with this new life. Likely would stop using reddit eventually too. Discord chat rooms doesn't replace the human touch which I craved now. Though I am not sure where to get it. I'm trying to adapt to this new life, one step at a time. Ya, its just one step at a time. I honestly dunno if I will harm myself again but I'm trying not to think about it. I really miss the hospital life, somehow. The nurses were all so nice. Can't say the same for the doctors hmmm...

Lastly, well... for sharing my experience. I guess, its also another means of asking for help in this new life forward. I will rest for now, then find a job. Recondition my muscle and have that liver checked, until my blood is normalized. The CK is still above normal and electrolyte is whacked. I ultimately went through a medical condition called ""rhabdomyolysis"" where muscles died due to my toxic overdose, which leads to even more complications. I was not diagnosed with any mental issues from IMH, just stressed out and tired in life. Otherwise, I'm all ok amazingly. Its a miracle, no organ damage? Maybe kidney failure in the future, not sure but otherwise just liver inflammation and some weird lung cough. Hmm... I'm still looking for a girlfriend though, though maybe less desperate. Just want someone to support me and for me to support in this new life, I'm not picky. Nurses would be great though XD. Well that's all I have to say for today, phew that was long.

 I'm an international student (not PR or citizen) who finished IB diploma in Singapore and was planning to go to UK/Canada for uni. I'm more interested in Computer Science as of now and had applied to most unis for the same. I got a handful of offers from UK and Canada but I narrowed it down to UBC in Canada. I was very invested in going to UBC since it wasn't gonna put a huge financial burden on my family plus it has a great campus and great location.

By the time we got our IB results (first week July), I was already done with course enrollment at UBC and had also made some friends there. The thing is, SG unis released their decisions recently and I got an offer from NTU for Computer Engineering with a minor in business. While the tuition fees aren't very far apart (I applied without grant as an international), my parents want me to stay in SG since its closer to home and due to the COVID situation. I visited the NTU campus, and I'm not trying to throw shade but I didn't really find the Computer Science and Engineering building too appealing as compared to UBC's campus. 

Overall, I see more benefits of going to UBC but my parents have the classic Asian mindset and want me to go to the university with a ""higher rank"". While narrowing down my universities I really didn't let rankings play any part since they are mainly based on research output which isn't something I'm interested in. UBC has quite a few significant benefits for me like the potential to become a Canadian citizen, free healthcare in Canada, cheaper cost of living than Singapore, closer to Amazon, Microsoft, Google HQ so more opportunities (esp since these big tech companies are investing more in Canada after Trump limited H1B) etc, however, my parents keep saying I can always do a master's there but I still believe in the Tech industry, skill matters more than degree so I'm not sure if I even want to do master's.

TLDR: As per title. I am really tired of the terms that the govt has been providing to describe the situation (Circuit Breaker, Stay Home Notice, Dorscon Orange, Phase One) but does not convey the severity properly.

I refer to the Phase One measures that was announced 1-2 days back. While I am angry because of the fact that I cannot legally meet my gf who is suffering from mental issues, I am more upset about the mixed messaging that was conveyed to us.

I literally do not understand, based on the measures, whether things are alright right now.

Why can people be able to visit their grandparents but unable to meet their significant other? Despite the fact that older people are more susceptible to the disease?

Why are there more people allowed back to work, but they are unable to talk physically while taking public transport?

Why are we allowing full services for Hairdressers, but we dont even allow eateries to have the choice on whether do they allow users to dine in?

How are teachers able to juggle Face to Face lessons with HBL ones with school staggered between levels other than the graduating ones?

It looks good when looking at Phase One Measures and assume that we are going on a right path, but none of the measures when applied together gives us the impression that we are slowly, but safely moving forward as a nation. It gives us the impression that we are still in Circuit Breaker mode, jus changed with a new name.

Naming is also a huge gripe as an issue. Why Circuit breaker instead of Lockdown? Why still Dorscon Orange instead of Dorscon Red? Why are we naming this Phase One that gives the assumption that we are moving forward but still keeping the same measures that Circuit breaker has?

I wish there was more consistency &amp; honesty with the measures provided. If we are still in circuit breaker mode, the government should have the courage to be honest and extend the circuit breaker, not half-assed measures like this. If we are out of circuit breaker, then at least have give people emotional relief, by allowing 1-2 members to visit them.

I apologize, as I am also not in a good place. With the gf struggling with homework, and inherent mental issues, and me having low motivation and drive to push myself forward, I was looking forward to the end of the circuit breaker as a drive to push myself thru the last stretch of uni.",,I wish the Government's Message for this pandemic were more upfront and honest.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gon77c/i_wish_the_governments_message_for_this_pandemic/

hndppk,1594199025,hndppk,247,,"[Below text is from Chandramohan KR on 6 July 2020 on his Facebook page]

Dear Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong,
 
The objective of this article is to highlight the incompetency in handling the COVID-19 by your team of leaders. The word, “leaders” in this article is referring to your consultants, parliament members, ministers and yourself involved in the handling of the COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

Firstly, the initial message given to the public: 
“DO NOT WEAR A MASK IF YOU ARE WELL” – this is an absolute no brainer statement made.

Please refer to the MOH link dated 29 Jan 2020, for evidence 
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/2019-ncov/english_advisory-on-wearing-masks.pdf

Please refer to the MOH link dated 4 Feb 2020 V3, for evidence
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/practise-good-personal-hygiene---english-(05-feb).pdf

I am an average common man. Through my friends in China, I came to know that wearing a mask is critical to protect ourselves from this disease. At that time, it is already known that the virus can be spread to another person before the infected person realises that they have the virus. 

Please refer to the MOH Link dated 3 Feb 2020, Read point 20.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/ministerial-statement-on-whole-of-government-response-to-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)

Even though this form of transmission is uncommon according to MOH, what did the government do to mitigate the threat effectively.

The government advised its citizens to wear a mask only if they were displaying symptoms associated with Covid-19. Rather than to make it mandatory for the whole population, only a weak advice was given. Many people do not heed this advice whether it be due to a lack of masks –most masks were obtained via personal expenses at the time- or due to other reasons. With many individuals not heeding this advice, the rampant spread of Covid-19 occurred. Masks were only made mandatory for all on the 14th of April as announced by Minister for national Development, Mr Lawrence Wong. Due to the delay in implementing a strict regulation of wearing masks in public, the number of cases had seen a spike from 596 cases on the 19th of April to 1426 on the 20th of April. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) most Covid-19 cases have an average of 5-6 days before the onset of symptoms with the longest being up to 14 days. The delay in implementing mandatory usage of masks in the public has led to such a rampant spread in the Covid-19. How could the leaders lack such common sense that the lack of mask usage would lead to the spread of the virus. 

With my little common sense, I made arrangements and shipped in surgical masks from Portugal and N95 masks from USA. I started to receive the masks on 17 February onwards.

I gave the surgical and N95 mask to my parents and asked them to use it together with hand sanitisers. My sister and myself also lectured to my parents on the importance of using face masks and hand sanitiser along with frequent hand washing. Both my parents work together and live together.

My parents have their own shop in Singapore shopping centre. I even told my father in early march to close his shop until the situation gets better.

My mother took my advice and religiously used the face mask along with hand sanitisers. However, my father trusted our governments stand on “Do not wear a mask if you are well”. Almost every week I met him and told him to use the facemask but he kept telling me that he is well and so there was no need to wear it. At times, he just wore it to please me in my presence and once I left the shop, he would remove it. 

Unfortunately, my father started feeling unwell on 5 April 2020. From 5 April, my father started to wear a mask. He followed the government advise. On the 6 April he consulted the Doctor for his fever. There was no other symptoms. Doctor suspected he is likely to have normal flu. The fever didn’t stop even with medication, so on 7 April, my mother brough my father to the same doctor. Again, there was no other symptoms expect the fever. The doctor told my parents to monitor closely. Later in the afternoon he developed very high fever, above 39 degrees Celsius. My mother immediately brought him to TTSH A&amp;E. From the X Ray report there was a slight inflammation in the lungs, and was admitted for pneumonia in TTSH. On 8 April morning about 5 am, I received a call from the hospital, “My father is COVID-19 positive, and he is transferred to NCID”. There he succumbed to COVID-19 on the 27 April 2020.

If the PAP government have not made such an incompetent statement “DO NOT WEAR A MASK IF YOU ARE WELL”, may be my father is alive today.

If my father did not trust the PAP government advice on this matter, may be he is alive today.

The last words from my father before he when into the ventilator
To my mother “It is better to die”
When I called to find out why he said that. He told me “He cannot take it. It is causing him a lot of discomfort and suffering”

His suffering is still haunting me.

Another, critical area of incompetency was in Feb 2020, we all are aware about the 5 Bangladesh workers from Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site were infected with COVID-19. 

Don’t your leaders know these workers might go to Mustafa Centre?
Don’t your leaders know they live in overcrowded communal living spaces?
Don’t your leaders know they socialise on Sundays in densely populated are with fellow workers from different living space across the island?
Don’t your leaders know this will link to many living spaces across our country?

As a common man, I could only list the above few. I am sure many more details have to be mitigated to prevent a disaster.

What was the immediate action taken to mitigate the disaster we are in now? If your leaders responsibly mitigated every element of threat seriously, we wouldn’t be in this situation now. Maybe my father is alive now. Next to Singapore Shopping centre where my father has a shop is the 9 Penang lane cluster. 

Please refer to the MOH Link dated 12 April 2020, for evidence.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/32-more-cases-discharged-233-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed

Please refer to the MOH Link, showing case 1647 was confirm on 8 April 2020.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex9-4.pdf

Many of construction workers patronise my father’s shop for drinks and snacks. My mother who works with my father told me, many of the workers bought lots of paracetamol on the last 1 week of his business. Hence, I highly suspect my father would have contracted it from one of them. Although our incompetent team still have not established a link to my father in its website.

Please refer to the MOH Link, showing case #1595, which is my fathers, still showing blank for link.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex---summary-of-confirmed-cases---8apr2020.pdf

Key points:
1. if the PAP government have not made an incompetent statement “DO NOT WEAR A MASK IF YOU ARE WELL”
2. address the first few cases of Bangladeshi workers seriously in detail and mitigate all treats.

If the COVID-19 situation was handled with competency right from day one, we would not have to waste $93 billion. This is the citizens hard-earned money.

Please refer to the link for the amount of Singaporean money wasted.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fortitude-budget-covid-19-parliament-passes-heng-swee-keat-12808172

It clearly shows, some of the leaders in the PAP government are incompetent in handling the COVID-19 situation. Which leads more than 43,000 people infected, and cost the public a lot of pain, stress as well as $93 billion lost to cushion the damage caused by the rampant spread of Covid-19 to the nation. I am not saying you could have saved it all, but you could have made the situation a lot better and spent much less if you had done the right thing with foresight.

In a private sector, if someone made an irrevocable mistake that leads to a few billion dollars lost, he or she would have been fired immediately. In the army, if an officer made a terrible mistake, he or she would be sacked or reprimanded and when the contract term ends, he or she will not be re-contracted.

Why can the following countries do better?
Hong Kong
Taiwan
New Zealand
Are their leader betters than ours?

Where is the accountability and ownership among our leaders? Was anyone responsible fired or asked to step down? 

I am not expecting a response to this article. I just hope you can employ the best person for the job. So that our country will not suffer from such situations again. There will be other challenges in the future for which we will need the best leaders in the world.

Yes, PSP did not win West Coast, nor did WP win in East Coast. But let's be pragmatic as it was never expected that the opposition would put up a strong showing, let alone win in these two constituencies.  Nor was it ever realistic that the PAP would be denied a supermajority in this election.

But most importantly, voters had forced the PAP to eat the humble pie this time round. It would have to reflect deeply, and with so many marginal seats to defend (even more so than GE2011) - West Coast (51%), East Coast (53%), Bukit Panjang (53%), Bukit Batok (54%), Marymount (55%) - i doubt the PAP would now have the political capital to pull stunts with us like the reserved presidency and POFMA for the next 5 years. PAP underestimated the number of swing voters and how attempting to hold an election in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic would backfire on them. It would now have to further engage the ground and listen to the people's concerns in the hopes of winning our support back.

iphgde,1599663488,iphgde,258,,"On June 8 2020, it was announced that TraceTogether tokens would be rolled out to segments of the Singapore population to bolster contact tracing efforts. The public response was swift and immense, requiring the minister in charge of the Smart Nation project, Vivian Balakrishnan, to publicly clarify on the token's supposed intensions and capabilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Among the clarifications was the statement that the app &amp; token program was to be voluntary, and mainly targeted at segments of the population that have trouble or no access to SafeEntry, such as the elderly. Source:  [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-contact-tracing-wearable-devices-trace-together-12815796](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-contact-tracing-wearable-devices-trace-together-12815796) 

&amp;#x200B;

And here we are, less than 100 days after the initial announcements and resulting backlash, a much larger rollout of the token to ALL Singaporeans along with trials at various public locations. From the ST article itself:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a separate press release, MOH and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office said this arrangement was trialled at a Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) events held at the end of August. More pilots will start progressively from October at larger-scale business-to-business events, before the programme expands further to include venues such as F&amp;B outlets, cinemas, gyms and certain workplaces. At these places, a visitor either has to scan the venue's QR code using the TraceTogether app on their mobile phone, or have the venue employee scan the QR code on the token.

&amp;#x200B;

This comment from /u/theony echoes my thoughts:

 

&gt;This is just off the top of my head so I might be wrong and I am open to be convinced. But I am seriously concerned about this.  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Never let a good crisis go to waste""*  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Rahm Emanuel  
&gt;  
&gt;When Trace Together first came out, I got it, and I got behind it. Contact tracing efforts can be enhanced by technology. The government gave assurances that privacy would be protected, but the true protection in my view was the fact that it was *voluntary*. When first introduced, it did not have the capability of linking your NRIC to it, and there were a slew of assurances given about protection of privacy (I did not and have not set it up and linked my NRIC to it like it suggests you do now).  
&gt;  
&gt;SafeEntry is mandatory. I get it. I can get behind it. It isn't invasive, just slightly inconvenient; if you want to go into the supermarket, or any building really, you have to register your entry.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the govt announced the Trace Together token, the messaging revolved around making contact tracing easier and raising the adoption rate. All of us were skeptical, and the govt took pains to explain that this is ""not a tracking device"", but what I could get behind was that there was a segment of the population that would find it difficult to use the app and so the token was good for them. See for e.g. [this article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/vulnerable-seniors-begin-receiving-tracetogether-tokens-from-sunday).  
&gt;  
&gt;I read many cynical comments when Trace Together first came out, about how the government would use it to track citizens. I dismissed them. I said: why would the government destroy their credibility by overreaching? I said: the system is voluntary, it's fine; the more crucial system, safe entry, is mandatory. I said: the government is acting wisely by doing the minimum necessary to ensure the outcomes we need.  
&gt;  
&gt;*""My life has become a single, ongoing revelation that I haven’t been cynical enough.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;\- James SA Corey, Babylon's Ashes  
&gt;  
&gt;I do think I'm fairly cynical, myself. But boy oh boy have I underestimated how cynical I need to be.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trace Together now is a different beast. You need to re-register with your nationwide identification numbers. The [stated rationale was that contacts needed to be identified more accurately and quickly](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/majority-of-tracetogether-users-have-not-re-registered-with-id-numbers).  
&gt;  
&gt;And now, it is going to be made mandatory.  
&gt;  
&gt;If SafeEntry is made mandatory... what good does the supposed granularity of Trace Together add? In theory, the benefit is that you would not quarantine the wrong people. E.g. people who forget to check out, or people who were nowhere near the infectious person. In practice? I don't buy it. The conservative course of action would be to quarantine everyone, to be safe. You mean to tell me that on the one hand, the govt is so concerned about inadequate contact tracing that they need to make this mandatory, but on the other hand, they are willing to risk people slipping through the cracks by not imposing quarantines on *everyone* at an affected location? The reasoning does not gel  
&gt;  
&gt;*What is the problem you are trying to solve*? Low adoption? Mandate Trace Together downloads (not the registration or linking with NRIC). That, together with Safe Entry, should get you enough of the way there. Isn't Trace Together a supplement? Isn't this enough? I am not convinced with any of the messaging thus far.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I have to enter my particulars into the app and have it saved there, ready for hacking? Ready for abuse by the government? When there appear to be less invasive solutions available? This is not a hypothetical concern. We *know* that governments overreach in times of crisis. We *know* that once governments enact laws to expand their powers to address crises, they are slow and loathe to let go of those powers. We *know* that governments will push to use their expanded powers for things other than what they were originally intended. *This is not a hypothetical concern. The history of the world is rife with such examples*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why are you pushing this now, when you haven't even cleaned up the hot mess that is the new clusters in our dorms? With Jo Teo's crocodile tears? You think we have forgotten?  
&gt;  
&gt;Why are you pushing this now, when I am not even convinced of the rationale of linking my NRIC to Trace Together?  
&gt;  
&gt;I say all of this as someone who is seriously concerned about Covid 19 and who is generally of the opinion that the PAP run administration has overall done a good job in handling our local situation with Covid 19. So, you know, the kind of person who is usually behind your actions.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have my cynical, skeptical hat fully on now. I think you're going to abuse this. I think you're going to use the contact tracing for things other than covid 19 contact tracing. I think once the crisis is over you are not going to relinquish these precedents easily, and you will give one excuse or another as to why you need to extend it a bit more, add on to it a bit more, enhance it a bit more.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prove me wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, the news that came out today sets a very dangerous precedent for our privacy &amp; data security. There is little (if any) legislation to ensure that this data will not be abused, mishandled or breached, and no check on how far reaching the trials will be. For all we know, the authorities could decide to maintain this practice of checking in and tracing even after the pandemic ends. For those that believe our data will not be mishandled or breached, the 2018 breach of SingHealth database and other instances of vendors not safeguarding data should worry you.

Number of unlinked cases are creeping up and knowing what happens in ALL other countries that downplayed the number of cases at the start, we can see where they are now. Exponential growth is no joke, everything will appear to be just fine until its not. WE must also understand that we're always 2 weeks behind the virus because of its incubation period.

gs8p24,1590680916,gs8p24,278,,"So I went cycling at the PCN early this morning, fairly smooth route to Jurong and back. On the way back, I saw this group of 5 malay guys (secondary – adult age?) on bike-sharing bikes on the opposite side of the canal being generally noisy and whatnot. Thought nothing of it at first and continued along, kids being kids, until they turned back at the bridge and came over to my side.

First incident happened when one of them overtook me, rode into my lane, and jammed his brakes so that I’d crash. Looking back, I should have probably called them out already, but I managed to avoid it in time, and gave him the benefit of the doubt that he accidentally lost control.

Second happened near the end of the park connector where it met up with the main road sidewalk. I slowed down to prepare to disembark to the sidewalk, but the same guy followed me all the way to the end, sped up and crashed into me from the back. High chance I may have gotten injured from the impact and possible fall, but luckily I had a foot close to the ground and stabilized myself. I turned around to see what happened, but his rental bike was already on the floor and he was running away while laughing.

Caught up with him since he dumped his bike, by which time his 4 other friends had already gathered. I questioned him on why he did it, and after a long time of hemming and hawing and beating around the bush, he eventually admitted “for fun lah!”, confirming that the actions were deliberate.

For further possible follow-up, I took a video of the group in question, at which point they started getting aggressive, threatened to beat me up if I didn’t delete the video, manhandled me and my bike to prevent me from moving away, and tried to snatch my phone.

""If here not Singapore, you die already""

Losing the video would mean I lose evidence of the perpetrators, but keeping it meant my safety is in danger. So I deleted the video in front of them while betting that Android would have a bunch of ways to restore deleted content (they did).

They left soon after and I got myself to somewhere safe before calling the police to make a report, thankfully with evidence on hand. Not quite the ride I was expecting to get that morning, but hey, at least I’m safe.

And the auntie comes and almost rudely asks for your choice of drink. You would of course tend towards ""milo peng"", if not one of the coffee or tea options.

This is fundamentally a problem in Singapore society, much like how PAP continues to hound us to use TraceTogether and how SMRT continues to make us pay more for slower trains. It borders on a national and even regional conspiracy, and we can thank no one other than the Nestlé gods who have brainwashed us as children. 

Thankfully, much like how PAP has Worker's Party and SMRT has Facebook complaints, Milo has its own antitheses which will be outlined in this expert dissertation. We'll be mainly looking at Ovaltine and Horlicks. Any fucker who says ""what about Vico"" deserves to get shot. We're looking for viable alternatives, not looking to be that edgy kid with that weird thing no one is having for obvious and valid reasons.

**The Company**

This is a quick point to get out of the way. Fuck Nestlé. Seriously. Fuck those water grubbing, child enslaving twats. Milo is made by Nestlé and they deserve to go down together.

**The Taste**

Listen, the only reason why Milo is so popular, much like chicken rice, is because they are very basic in composition. Milo is literally chocolate, sugar, and a bit of dairy. Which moron is going to say no to that? Both Horlicks and Ovaltine has more to offer, however. The former discards chocolate in its entirety, instead maxing out its stats in the malt section, creating a new and unique flavour. Ovaltine is the centrist here, having a good mix of chocolate and malt, boasting a weird but nice taste ping-ponging between bitter chocolate and sweet malt.

The point is, Milo is nothing special. It's a glorified hot chocolate in a cardboard packet. 

**Nutrition**

Let's not pretend any of them are healthy. If you want to stay fit, water is the way to go. But Milo seems to be least healthy one. All three drinks contain an obscene amount of sugar, but they try to compensate with some chemicals that provide vitamins. It is hard to draw a good comparison considering how each product comes with another 5 differnt sub-products and they all display their nutrition differently, but looking at various articles and photos, Milo is the clear loser. Despite the sportsmen dancing across their packaging, they're hardly contributing to your daily nutritional needs.

Horlicks comes in first with a good variety of nutrients in high amounts, while Ovaltine falls second because of its higher sugar content and moderately lower amounts of nutrition. There's a good [chart here] (http://www.ricebowlasia.com/milo-ovaltine-vico-horlicks-which-is-the-better-beverage/) that summarises some of the findings.

**Peripherals**

Fun fact, when Starbucks released some [new local-flavoured products] (https://www.cosmopolitan.com/food-cocktails/a10395054/starbucks-new-singapore-flavors/) did they include Milo with Horlicks and Ovaltine? No.

it7khs,1600172135,it7khs,282,,"Hi all,

I've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so. 

I returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS. 

October 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my right of passage from an ""Ah Boy"" to a ""Man"". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly one of the worst coughs I've ever had and thought to myself; 

""You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior"" 

Despite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on. 

As weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough. I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91. I mention these IPPT scores not to show off but to show you how unexpected a sickness may arrive, even when you think you are in the pink of health. 

Mid-November: I notice a lump in my neck!

While having swimming lessons at HTA, which by the way, honestly is a beautiful camp, I felt slight discomfort while doing different types of strokes. I felt my neck and realised there was a large lump. I didn't think much of it, and assumed it was my lymph nodes swelling up because of my cough. A few days after that discovery, the antibiotics and cough syrup I received started to wear off and my cough came back in full force. I went to the MO once again, but this time mentioned my inflated Lymph Nodes. I was given another round of antibiotics and was told; if the lymph nodes don't swell down come back. 

A Christmas surprise: My lymph nodes never decreased in size. 

We were lucky enough to receive a few days Block leave to celebrate Christmas and the New Year's. I quickly flew back to KL to see my friends and family. Despite having an amazing time there, the fact that my lymph nodes kept increasing in size was keeping me from fully enjoying myself. My flight back to SG was on a Sunday morning and I had to report back to camp by Sunday evening. As soon as I landed, I went to the nearest clinic right before closing time. The doctor took down my symptoms and told me he suspected there was a slight chance this might be Tuberculosis which itself carries a 6 month treatment plan. He gave me a few days MC and referred me to Polyclinic to get an x-ray. By the way, big-ups to the Singapore Public health care system; it's truly out of this world. Anyways, the x-ray came back inconclusive so, I was sent to Changi General Hospital for an MRI on the 31st of December and this is where things took a turn towards the dark. The doctor came back with the results and mentioned it might be tuberculosis, or it might be a cancer of the lymph nodes. My face went pale, and immediately felt the need to cry. We were not sure of it yet, so I told myself; I'm 18, fit and healthy. There is no way in hell I have cancer. To confirm doctor's suspicions, I was sent to SGH where I met, in my opinion the world's best oncologist. There, they suggested I did a biopsy (small procedure on my neck to remove a lymph node) and a PET-Scan (heavily prevalent scan to detect cancer growth over time). 

January 10th brought my life's most devastating news yet: I was alone. I went to see my Oncologist to get my results. My parents had important things to attend to overseas and were instead with me on the phone during the meeting. My doctor asked my parents to fly down and I assumed the worst. She wanted my parents to be here with my while she announces the news but I couldn't handle the wait and asked her bluntly; did I have cancer, yes or no. She nodded sympathetically, and my whole life flashed before eyes. I felt like breaking down. I cannot find words intense enough to describe the absolutely horrid feeling of someone informing you that you are cancer ridden, let alone at the young age of 18. When my parents arrived, I was given the full diagnosis. Stage 4A Nodular Sclerosis Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The cancer had spread to to my neck, my lungs, my spine and the bone on my ass. I thought I must've had a small beginner cancer at first since I didn't feel any worse than unusual except for incessant itching and night sweats, but nope, I was given the creme de la creme of bad diagnoses.

The following days went by quickly, I accepted my situation and was ready to tackle cancer. Before I knew it, I found myself in a hospital bed receiving chemotherapy. The most unexpected, emotionally and physically painful experience I've endured. There were multiple complications which landed me around 1.5 months in hospital, sleepless nights, losing sight of what feeling normal felt like and just feeling content with not being in excruciating pain. And the stress with COVID as well! Either way, I went through my 12 rounds of chemotherapy as best as I could with the amazing support of my parents taking care of me, solely moving back to Singapore to be with me. I tried to live my life as normal as I could and realised that was foolish and to instead, take things at my new pace of life. 

It is now September, 9 months post my diagnosis and 2.5 months post my last chemotherapy. You truly don't appreciate life until it might be taken away from you. As cheesy as it sounds, it's true. I was given a second chance at life and never take a day for granted. Each day brings it's own beautiful wonders and sometimes hardships. Just be thankful we are all alive and love the people around you as they are the ones who come forward in your time of need. Many lessons were learnt during my treatment and although I am not grateful for having had cancer, I appreciate much more who I am now than who I was before cancer. 

Thank you to the amazing doctors and nurses at SGH and everyone at SPF who was involved with my case. The Singaporean community really is the most giving and caring although it might not always seem like it.

If you made it all the way down here, thank you for reading. Writing this brought back the first tears since the end of chemotherapy :')

I've had a cough for the last week, no big deal, its not covid-19 nor do I have any other symptoms. My mother went to the pharmacy and got smooth talked into buying a $20 bottle of expectorant (cough medicine that thins out the mucus, helping you to cough it up) because the pharmacist told her its ""very good"". Its behind the counter medication which requires you to show the pharmacist your IC.

Now, shes under the impression that beacuse she had to show her IC when buying it, it is the good stuff and will cure the cough in no time.

I tried to explain that the stuff behind the counter is behind the counter to prevent people from overusing them, and does not necessarily mean that they are ""very good"" and will cure you quickly.

She started shouting ""don't argue, the pharmacist recommended it, i had to use my IC to buy it, it is very good, you won't die if you drink it"".

I also tried to explain that the expectorant wont ""cure"" the cough because thats not how it works, and that there are different types of coughs that it might not be suitable for, but you can imagine how that went.

All I tried to do was correct the misunderstanding she had, and she reacted badly because she won't accept the possibility that she might be wrong.

The double irony?

fm41s6,1584743044,fm41s6,333,,"Hi everyone, I've been thinking about lots of the assumptions behind this app and the technologies which enable it to work, as well as the effectiveness of the proposal. I've come to several key conclusions.



**Privacy**: The logic of this app is that it does not geo-locate or give away any identifiable information. While I did not develop the app, I do understand the principles behind it. It will drop 'handshake tokens' to other bluetooth enabled devices, within its range of 10 meters, which are encrypted. Now why should we be unafraid of this app?

* A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

* B. Duration of contact and proximity to other users. Note that it does not track where you visit. Even if you've been going to some less than desirable places, even if the police wanted to catch you out for visiting a red light district, they CANNOT find this information out from this app. You could have met the person who was infected on the bus, plane, train, car, whatever it is, it only reveals connections and not places. This proximity data is similarly encrypted, which all provides the same level of protection as previous mentioned above. If we take the government at their word, and the apple store with their policies and tight protection concerns about their users, we can very safely assume, short of some global conspiracy where Singapore's government is the FBI,CIA,FSB,NSA,Chinese Intelligence, GIGN, and all other intelligence agencies rolled into one, that we cannot have this information be leaked. 

* C. It cannot phone home to a central server. All information is kept on your device until the special PIN is provided to upload the encrypted data to MOH. It does not do anything beyond what is needed, that is, to use bluetooth and just handshake ONLY with other devices with the app. It cannot even collect data about devices which are bluetooth enabled around you. That is how specific and precise this app is. It collects ONLY what is needed and ONLY when necessary, that information that was collected will be uploaded. It is not going to steal your contact list or your nude photographs.

* D. Bluetooth is a short-ranged signal only ranging up to 10 meters at most. It is also low energy, which means it cannot cause cancer or whatever people are going to assume about radiation. It cannot make a call to a satellite and tell the FBI to come rappelling down via helicopter, nor can it intercept and leak all your private messages. Bluetooth is just another form of signal, one which is VERY short ranged. No one is going to 'hack' via bluetooth, because no one usually gets close enough to the target (5 meters) away and begin frantically typing away on your keyboard. If you do see such people please walk away from them and you will be safe.

EVEN if it is leaked, these are only phone numbers which are not particularly revealing. It will be used for the SOLE purpose of contacting you to inform you about risk, to interview about who you are in contact with, and how you can mitigate that risk, and if you need to be quarantined. It will keep your friends, family and colleagues safe. 

I should remind you that commerical apps, things like google home, and even your email and website usage are phoning home with your statistics all the time. If you can trust facebook, google, netflix, instagram, twitter, youtube, your email, you're already giving someone else your data. This app collects less data than all those other commonly used apps.

**Mathematics**: The principle of statistics make the utility of this app are undeniable, and the nature of the app and distributions about people, apps and disease make it even more compelling to download the app. We can make some key assumptions here about all these factors.

All assumptions here are napkin math, and written at 0400 in the morning, but I hope you can correct any erroneous assumptions.
Lets assume the users of the app are randomly distributed across Singapore. I realize this is not very realistic, but it is for the sake of argument. 

The app allows us to create a chain of contacts in the community by looking at how long you've been in contact with the person, and how close you've been to that person, and how frequently you've been in contact. All these facts will help establish how risky it is for you to have the virus if you're exposed to a known case.

Let us assume the people infected with the virus are also similarly distributed across Singapore.

Let us assume that both of these events are independent and cannot affect each other in any way.

Assume P(Have COVID19) is 385 / 5.7 million -- Number of cases / Population of Singapore

This is 0.00006754385. 

Now it becomes a question of if a person who has the app also has COVID19.

Multiply P(Have the App) and P(Have COVID19), which we've delightfully assumed to be independent events, so it is just 0.00006754385*P(Have the App).

How can we know the probability of you having the app? That's where this message comes in. This message is hopefully a factor which will convince to stop being lazy and to download the app, and use it properly. As of the time of writing, the app has 364 ratings on the Apple App Store. According to quora, some developers estimate about a 1% ratings penetration. We will assume the same. Thus on iOS we have maybe 35000 downloads. 

The iOS to Android Market Share is about 2:1, assuming that both iOS and Android users have the same general habits, we can assume about 70000 downloads for the android platform.

This puts us at 100000 downloads. If we only have half of these users use the app properly, we will have 50,000+/5.7 Million people with the app. This is about 0.9%, which I will round to 1% for the sake of convenience.

So this equation right now is
0.00006754385*P(Have the App) = 0.00006754385*0.01 = 6.75438596e-7 Such a small number!

How effective can this be? 
Well think about our daily interactions. The risk of exposure to COVID-19 scales with duration and proximity, so not all encounters are made equal, but think about how many people you come into contact with daily. 

Your grab driver, your coffeeshop aunties, your colleagues, bosses, teachers, classmates, friends and family. If we assume a conservative 5 people a day that you meet, that means that daily in singapore, 5.7 million people have 5 interactions each, all with the possibility of getting the virus. This works out to about 30 million interactions. 

Each one of those interactions multiplied with that number above will give us the number of EXPECTED exposures daily, with the app. This is 20.263155. That means we have a potential of about 20 people to be contacted via the app to break the chain of transmission, and this is only at 1% of all singaporeans using the app! Please, please, please download this app. It gets exponentially better the more people use it. 

TL;DR

This app is genius and can actually solve COVID19 Spread. Please download. It will only take a small amount of time, it is safe, secure, reliable, and can save your life and mine. It is not SGSecure, it is a well thought out principle made by some incredibly smart people @ govtech. It will help stop this virus. It will not invade your privacy or make you go to jail. It is one of the most simple and elegant solutions i've seen in an app, and it is relevant now. It will save the life of your ah gong, your ah man, your caifan seller, your boss (even if you dont like him or her very much) your wife, your children, and your own.

ev0q9n,1580186779,ev0q9n,365,,"In this midst of the novel coronavirus spreading around the world, there seems to be a certain narrative around some commenters in this sub and even from the health minister himself, that somehow Singaporeans are revealing their xenophobic tendencies when reacting to the outbreak. I think it is absolutely abhorrent to be making political insinuations at this current juncture, given that this is completely a non political issue and any attempts to view it from that lens should be utterly rejected.

Now to be clear, my heart goes out to the people in China who are fighting the outbreak. But at the same time, it is a false dichotomy to suggest that being empathetic to their plight cannot coexist with taking more actions, drastic or otherwise, to assuage the worry and anxiety of the populace here in our own country.

It is not xenophobic to suggest that Singapore should consider a travel ban on China or other more drastic quarantine measures. With the first 4 cases in Singapore, I was initially convinced that current measures for screening were adequate. But given the new emergence of an asymptomatic carrier, it would appear that such methods are no longer foolproof. If the government’s only reaction is to invoke a 14 days leave of absence for those who travelled to China, then I think like many other commenters I have little faith that it will be effective, due to many other factors. If a travel ban is not feasible, it is the government’s responsibility to come up with other measures, but more must be done.

It is not anti-immigration to suggest that Singapore’s inclination towards foreign immigration makes it more susceptible to viruses and diseases that might be spread from overseas. We can do a cost-benefit analysis another day, but we cannot deny this is one of the drawbacks an open immigration policy will incur.

It is not racist to condemn people who partake and endorse the culture of eating 野味. Obviously not all Chinese people partake in this, but the fact remain that many zoonotic diseases are derived from improper handling of bushmeats or wild animals and anyone in support of these, whether in a personal or group capacity, should be condemned.

It is not discrimination to want to avoid being in the vicinity of anyone from Wuhan/China, or who travelled to these locations in the past 14 days, given the existence of asymptomatic carriers, and the high virulence of the virus. It is a matter of basic public health consideration.

It is not bias to doubt the veracity of official information, or any other information derived from China’s official updates, given the history of China’s censorship and past handling of SARS.

It is not sensationalist to suggest that the virus could be much more serious than the cases that have happened in Singapore. Many of my friends and family are still convinced that the virus is no more lethal than a normal flu, since the perception given is that everything is under control, with no deaths in Singapore as of right now. In fact, because the virus exhibits symptoms extremely similar to the normal flu for a healthy individual, more care must be taken to prevent the vulnerable from being infected. Otherwise, it would just be a ticking time bomb before someone who is vulnerable gets infected.

So please, the next time before you start making xenophobic claims, remember that just because you’re healthy and strong and can likely resist the virus, does not mean you can invalidate the concerns of those who have a weaker immune system, painting all their concerns, worries, suggestions in the same brush as xenophobia and overreactions, because these are the people who have a genuine cause for concern.",,A rant about the the current discussion on the coronavirus,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ev0q9n/a_rant_about_the_the_current_discussion_on_the/

hrorgl,1594824012,hrorgl,374,,"**Economic downturn is here and more Singaporeans will fall through the cracks. I hope we can share our experiences with each other.**

**Here goes my story...**

Ever since early 2000s, my family struggled financially after my father was retrenched, due to the economic downturn. No companies wanted to hire him, despite his experience and capabilities, because he was deemed too old (in his 50s) and over-qualified for junior roles, couldn't even get past the recruiters.

After my father's start-up attempt failed, he took up any jobs possible that barely keep us afloat (Warehouse Executive in the day, Cook at fast food restaurant at night), because if he didn't, we would not be able to cover HDB loan, bills, debts and other expenses. He put up with the bullying from his boss (heavy workload, deducting his pay whenever something goes wrong) because he really needed the job. When he went to Social Services for financial help during the most desperate times, he recounted that the process was very demeaning and felt like a beggar. We got some financial aid, but it was far from enough.

Prior to that, I was blessed to have had resources (for enrichment classes, tuition etc..) for development, went to good schools and received good grades. As a result, my parents pinned high hopes on me that I would be the one to ""rescue"" the family, that kept them going during the difficult times. During the worst period, we nearly lose our home and had no money for our meals.

During my JC years, I was giving tuition to earn my pocket money. My parents didn't know I was struggling inside, I couldn't tell them, they had already crumbled under the immense pressure. They were miserable and started buying 4D, because they thought they could buy ""a hope"", they were happy only when they strike. I was crumbling under their heavy expectations, stress of going hungry, sense of shame from not having enough money to eat, maintaining my grades in a top JC. I was exhausted and had no one to confide in, even though I had people to hang out with.

I was falling into depression and couldn't absorb what I was studying. As expected, I didn't do well for the A levels, that sense of failure spiraled me further into depression. (I internalised the stigma of seeking therapy, because I thought the record would become a obstacle in my future, and if I hang in there, it would go away) My parents told it was ok, but I know it's not from the way they behaved,

I refused to go down like that, I started working while my friends enter Uni. I thought I can save enough and pay for my own education (no one could be my guarantor for school loan), I was very clear about what my strengths are and what to study. I survived on less than $5 a day and enrolled in part-time degree after work. My mother would ask me for money for family expenses from time to time, I would give it to her to see her worry less. I was pushing myself very hard, lack of sleep and irregular meal times, my physical and mental health deteriorated. I went to Feiyue for free counselling service, the counsellor was kind but the only thing he could advice me, was to leave my family. It's impossible because I couldn't afford anymore financial burden to myself (rent. get my own household items etc..).

One day, my mother told me my father was going to get into big trouble, if I didn't help him pay off his debt. I didn't have the heart to let more misfortune befall him. I was totally crushed, that was my last straw. Even when I worked so hard to save, I couldn't study as I wanted, all my savings gone, just like that. I was very dejected and lived like a zombie, my parents said I should pull myself together and pressured me to do something productive.

&gt;!I couldn't take it anymore, the pain was just too overwhelming. I was standing by the window, almost ready to take a dive. My sibling pulled me off the window, we hugged and cried. I know I need professional help immediately (because if I don't, there is no future to talk about).!&lt;

I went to the polyclinic and got a referral to see a psychiatrist at KTP Hospital, diagnosed with depression and given medication. Experience with my doctor was poor, he was uncaring and insensitive, but I carried on, took my medication because it worked for me. I asked if there was any support group I could join, he said ""nope"" and that was it.

I returned to work after I felt ready again. I had a hard time looking for a job, the recruiters questioning about the gaps in my resume, the tone as though there I did something wrong. I was especially afraid of a section on the form that requires me to declare whether I have any mental illness. (thankfully this section is no longer around) When I finally found one, I cherished it and did my best, got praises and then the bullying from co-workers started. I hanged on and stood my ground, but gradually it took a toll on me, and my depression relapsed. I told myself that I have to fight the right battles in life, and I quit my job.

This break is the turning point in my life, as I started going for psychotherapy and working out issues that I had. **I strongly recommend anyone who is suffering from any trauma to seek therapy ASAP, don't bottle it up until it becomes debilitating, because the body keeps score and it will always win.**

I'm in recovery and felt better than before I had depression, with a newfound understanding of myself. I convinced my parents to seek help for gambling addiction, and the financial situation improved. I am very proud of them for doing that.

However, I'm struggling with fears of being asked about the gaps in my resume when I apply for jobs, how people feel about working with someone with mental illness. Now in my early 30s, my struggle is far from over, I have problem finding a sustainable job without degree, and now I also have to worry about my parents' medical bills. I want to love and marry someone, have my own family, but I don't think I can afford to do so (My bf of many years broke up with me because he saw no hope in my situation).

A very big part of my life revolved around my personal battles that I cannot put onto my resume to add value, and too afraid to tell others because I don't want to be labelled as a failure by societal standards, or that I'm trying to get sympathy. Life is about spending time with your loved ones, having enough food to eat, a place to stay, doing meaningful work. I still want to work towards it.

I don't know how the future will turn out for me, I'm lost now. I was unemployed before Covid-19 hit, and did part-time job on and off, now my source of part-time jobs is gone too. I don't dare to sign up for jobs that has a lot human contact, because I'm afraid of passing the virus to my 2 elderly parents. I am trying to self-learn digital design (through free courses), and now I heard market is bad.

My story has come a full circle, from one economic downturn to this one. Thank you for reading all the way here. It's going to be tough but I hope by sharing my story, you know you are not alone.

ggdnk5,1589022595,ggdnk5,377,,"So I came here from another country when I was a toddler. Yes, I’m still a PR, not by choice but due to my parents’ stubbornness. 

I was enrolled in local schools until the end of secondary one (imagine one of the top 3 secondary schools in singapore) after which I told my parents that I’m not heading back to the school. I then started at an international school, finished the remaining years and left for the UK to pursue tertiary studies. 
I’m now back in singapore due to this virus situation and some of the stuff that’s been happening is shocking. Examples: 

1. Went to a mall and some lady came up to me and said ‘go back to where You came from, you dirty foreign worker’ and no one bats an eyelid. 

2. The security guard at the mall mocked my ‘blue IC’. 

3. Taxi driver who drove me from Changi to my house lamented on how I ‘lead an atas life’ and this is why singaporeans are suffering. (???) 

I’ve been told how my tanned skin is ‘dirty and disgusting’ all my life while I was in singapore and I’m not even offended anymore but when my British friends hear this, their opinion of singapore really changes. 

I’m also unsure how my parents (who btw work their arses off to provide for me) are causing the locals suffering because I’m pretty sure singapore is a country that offers opportunities based on talent and merit. 

Nothing comes to any of us for free and we are all working for what we earn. Also accidentally brushing past me isn’t going to ‘make you black’. 
Throwing a child’s bag out of the classroom or making her or him eat/spend recess in the toilets aren’t going to change the fact that he or she is your classmate. 

I’ve arrived here after 2 years now and I’m just shocked that people are continuing to say such things. 
Though a PR at the moment, I definitely consider myself a proud citizen of this wonderful country. 

I would like to ask all of you to please consider how we as a country felt so unwelcome when our fellow citizen was attacked quite recently in London which I’m sure most of us have heard about. It is essential to create an environment that welcomes everyone regardless of race, religion, color or nationality for all of us to have good memories attached to the time we have spent here.",,I’ve been in this country for 22 years now and nothing has really changed.

hp3h03,1594439618,hp3h03,401,,"I was manning one of the polling stations yesterday, and I got a lot of questions from friends so I thought you guys would be interested too.

First - none of us volunteered, we were simply assigned. You can get out of it only if you're pregnant, or if you are on MC (whether keng or real). We get paid ~$250-300, which sounds great, but the hours are terrible. To earn this money you need to:

- do a 1-2h online course
- attend a 3h training in person
- for a few people, i think there was a separate training session to learn to operate the machine that scans your NRIC
- help to set up the polling station the day before (4h for most people, but I was asked to go down for another 2.5h in the morning to do inventory check)
- Anf of course Polling day itself - we were originally told 6am-8.30pm, but some of us had to be there at **4.45am**, and of course after the extension we ended up leaving at 10.30pm.

So even if you ignore the 2h extension, i think the pay works out to about $10/hour. And you deal with some weird shit which i'll talk about later

##Are my votes secret? Aren't there PAP people watching you at the polling station?

Yes, from what I can see votes are really secret, there's a serial number on the ballot paper but it's impossible to trace each vote back to a voter without anyone knowing. And yes, each contesting party can send people down to witness the process, PAP always has witnesses there but opposition may not, but they cannot see what vote you cast. Nor can they recognise the faces of everyone who went in.

##Did you know about the 2h extension? What happened?

We only found out about the 2h extension at 7+. In fact our supervisor was as confused as us, she told us that she saw the news on CNA website but ELD hasn't given any instructions. We had a lot of questions (especially since 7-8pm was supposed to be for higher-risk patients and we had to wear mask/face shield/gown/gloves) but she said she had no idea either. 

Our polling station didn't really have a long queue for most of the day, but i guess some others did? Each polling station was supposed to have 20+ people manning it, but only 6 will stay back and don all the biohazard gear to serve people on MC and SHN. By the time we heard about the extension, we were down to 6 people wearing all wearing the gear. Then 10min later, our supervisor was told that all 20+ people should man the station from 7-9pm, and only wear the gear from 9-10pm for the sick/SHN voters. But by that point we already wore all our gear, and ELD did not provide us with any extra gear, so we couldn't take it off (otherwise we wouldn't have any left for later). And our supervisor decided that since one SHN person had voted at 7+, the 6 of us should wear the gear and man the whole station from 7-10pm. 

##How does wearing the gear feel?

There was a N95 mask, face shield, gown and gloves. Wearing the gear was really uncomfortable, especially for 3 hours. I have no idea how nurses and doctors do it all day.

Breathing through N95 mask made my face all sweaty, and the face shield trapped all the heat around my face. Plus the face shield kept slipping off, it was really loose. I couldn't really sit properly on a chair because the back of the gown was taped up, and if i leaned back the masking tape would stick to the chair. We couldn't use our phones, and my polling station had less than 10 voters during those 3 hours, so we mostly just sat around and chatted and complained about our miserable lives.

##How come some polling stations have gloves for voters and some don't?

I believe ELD kept flip flopping on this. Our supervisor was equally frustrated. We were trained to offer gloves to all voters after sanitising their hands, and to encourage them to wear one even if they didn't want to. Some time in the late morning, we were told to skip the gloves. Then a few hours later, we were told to put the gloves on the table, so that people could take them if they wanted, but not to offer it. Then later we were told that we could tell voters there were gloves for those who wanted, and they could take one themselves. And then we were later told that if they wanted one, we should take it for them, so they don't touch the whole stack and contaminate everything.

Why? No idea.

##How come the voteq.gowhere.gov.sg site isn't accurate? How come it's not updated?

The site might look nice, but how it works is that one of the people manning the polling station has to MANUALLY update the number every few minutes. Basically, you go to a webpage and tap on ""&lt;10 voters"", ""10-20 voters"", etcetc. It's so strange, it's like... if i printed out an email and started faxing it to people. ELD should have installed sensors to detect people entering or exiting, but i guess human labour was cheaper. 

When it got really busy, the guy updating the website had to deal with other questions and was helping out somewhere else doing double duty. 

Also, there are one or two times when a busload of old people would come down, and the queue would jump from 5 people to 40 people. When that happens our first instinct is to help the voters find chairs, direct them accordingly, etc, and not to update the website.

##Was it difficult?

Dealing with difficult people was the worst. Especially old people who tended to be stubborn.

Common questions:

**""My polling station is too far away, why can't I vote here? Same GRC what""** - We can only allow you to vote at your designated polling station, I don't know why. No, I can't change the rules just for you. No, the fact that you knew Toh Chin Chye doesn't change anything. I'm sorry you can't walk very far, I still can't do anything. No, Lee Hsien Loong did not personally write you a letter saying you can vote here - that is a mass mailer to everyone saying ""please vote for PAP"", not ""dear Ms Tan, I grant you permission to vote at another polling station"". No, I can't change policy for you, I'm just here to carry out orders. No, shouting about it won't help, except that it gives my supervisor a chance to get the police to come over.

**""I didn't bring NRIC or passport, why can't I use my driving license/Passion card/ezlink/etc?""** - There are rules governing which forms of ID are allowed, and it has to be one which you have to physically collect. No, I can't change the rules just for you. No, the fact that you knew Toh Chin Chye doesn't change anything. I'm sorry you can't walk very far, I still can't do anything. No, I don't know who you are or how many people you have under you, I don't care and it won't help. No, I can't change policy for you, I'm just here to carry out orders. No, shouting about it won't help, except that it gives my supervisor a chance to get the police to come over.

**""Why is my name not on the eligible list?""** - If your name was struck off, you probably didn't vote last time, or were overseas. You can apply to reinstate yourself, but not today and not here. No, I can't do it for you. No, I can't get you the person who can do it, call ELD yourself, I have other people i need to entertain. No, I don't care that you had such an amazing overseas career, I can't reinstate you myself. No, I don't care that you support the PAP, that has nothing to do with whether you can vote. No, I don't know who you are or how many people you have under you, I don't care and it won't help. No, I can't change policy for you, I'm just here to carry out orders. No, shouting about it won't help, except that it gives my supervisor a chance to get the police to come over.

**""Don't touch my NRIC. I don't want your germs""** - Trust me, I don't want yours either. If you can put it down for us to verify, and I don't have to touch it, I won't. But if you hold it up and your hands are shaky or you are too far away I can't see your NRIC number. Giving me a 3-minute lecture on COVID and droplets actually means that you're spewing more droplets from your mouth, and your're forcing me to explain to you and spew more droplets from my mouth, and it lengthens your stay inside the polling station, so ironically if you had quietly let me put two (gloved and sanitised) fingers on your NRIC, it would have been a lower health risk for you.",,Thoughts from an Election Official,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hp3h03/thoughts_from_an_election_official/

It is not an exaggeration to say that there is growing, palpable discontent and frustration on the ground, about how the COVID-19 crisis is being handled.

Much of the anger is directed at the inconsistencies in policies. On one hand, we want to ensure safe distancing, so we cannot meet friends. Yet on the other hand, crowds are allowed on public transport. Pictures of Minister Khaw removing safe distancing stickers from the MRT certainly do not help. The message that is sent out is inconsistent and often confusing.

Supermarkets like NTUC are crowded, and yet budget stores where we get our toothpaste and other essentials are not allowed to open. You cannot blame us for wondering how policymakers decide which establishments can open and which cannot.

We want to reopen the economy slowly for safety reasons, therefore only some services can resume after the circuit breaker. Restaurants still cannot open to diners; beauty and wellness services remain closed. The reason, we are told, is that beauty services are not essential. Yet, on the other hand, people are allowed to spend three hours in a hair salon getting their hair dyed and permed. Candy stores are allowed to open. 50% discounts are abound in some stores so everyone is rushing to buy chocolates. What is the logic in that?

Schools have reopened. School children are now congregating back at schools. Yet we are not even allowed to see our relatives. I dearly miss my niece and nephew, my auntie, my close friends whom I consider my family. I cannot bear a situation where we are penalized and kept apart even longer because clusters start breaking out from schools and on public transport. Meanwhile, orr parents cannot come to our homes, but we can visit them, 2 at a time. What is the logic in that? And what difference does it make whether it is 2 people or 4 people if we all come from the same household?

We rejoiced when the fortitude budget announced that charities now enjoy a 1 for 1 match of up to $250,000 in donations from Tote Board. However shortly after that we found out that we do not qualify because we have applied for a previous, similar program. What is the point then of announcing this initiative, if another one was already present?

We prided ourselves so much in not having to shut down the economy when COVID-19 first started in January to March 2020. However, we now seem to have swung the other way. We all wish we had more time to spare, but the economy cannot wait. Singapore is bracing for it's worst-ever recession, and many companies are expected to close. My friend who runs a buffet restaurant told me that four years of hard work has gone down the drain in just three months.

We know that the situation is evolving rapidly. We understand how difficult the situation is for policymakers to have to make split-second decisions. We understand that it is a difficult line to tow. Whatever policy is made, there will be people on the other side who are unhappy. However, policy makers need to give more thought into making policies which are consistent and fair.

All Singaporeans want the same thing. We want Singapore to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis as safely as possible. We stand united, and in solidarity. However bit by bit, our confidence is being eroded. I wish so much, to once again feel the immense pride of being a Singaporean, as I did at the beginning of the year, when Singapore handled the crisis swiftly and decisively.",,A rant on Govt's handling of CB that I don't think many would disagree,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gy1wsa/a_rant_on_govts_handling_of_cb_that_i_dont_think/

hmn6qy,1594093833,hmn6qy,505,,"I was planning to keep mum during this election period but the amount of shit show that transpired over the past 2 weeks had made it really difficult. I feel that the majority of Singaporeans don’t understand how the PAP thinks and operates. They are completely missing the big picture of why you should be voting against them if you want a better Singapore for Singaporeans.

Like a broken looping cassette, opposition parties have been using the soundbite of “checks and balances” as the primary reason for why should vote for them; to get them into parliament. They’re not wrong. Having opposition MPs ask hard questions in parliament is one of many ways to hold the PAP accountable for their decisions. But in my opinion, that isn’t very effective. After all, as long as the PAP has the supermajority in the parliament, they can still defer all opposition concerns and bulldoze any bills they want to or change the constitution as they wish. And let’s not kid ourselves, PAP will in all likelihood have an overwhelming majority in the parliament again. It is actually the side effect of voting for opposition that truly keeps the PAP in check, which is making them feel like they could lose support and power anytime.

Let me explain my rationale. 

The PAP has always been a center right pro capitalism party that frowns upon the notion of a welfare state. From early 2000s to 2011, Singapore was full on chasing for GDP growth. Property prices spiralling out of control, influx of foreign workforce was at its highest and PRs/Citizenships were being given out like freebies. But after Singaporeans expressed their unhappiness at the polls of GE2011, giving them only 60% of popular votes, things changed rapidly.

In the next 5 years, these policies were rolled out

- Property cooling measures were introduced less than half a year after GE 2011. This prevented investors from speculating the market, housing prices were immediately controlled at the expense of our GDP.
- Annual budget allocated for social transfers it's biggest jump from 2011 to 2015. For comparison, from 2008 to 2011, budget for social transfers to individuals increased about 45%(from 1.1 to 1.6billion). From 2011 to 2015, it increased by about 210%(1.6 to 3.3billion). In terms of progressive increment, that’s a 450% difference between these two periods.
- Pioneer generation package was launched in 2014, this eased up medical bills for the elderlies.
- Silver support scheme was announced in 2014 and eventually enacted in 2015. This is essentially a quarterly pension scheme for elderlies living in poverty, something which was frowned on by the PAP in the past.
- A sharp decline in foreign work force intake. It declined from 77k to 26k per annum between 2011-2015. Remember how we were constantly told to ‘bite the bullet’ for economic growth regarding foreigners in the late 2010s?
- Decline in total PRs granted. From 2008 to 2011 we granted an average of 50k PR year after year. From 2011 onwards, it's about 30k

During these 5 years, the PAP introduced more social policies aimed at helping Singaporeans than in any other period. I cannot help but to make a connection between PAP’s fear of losing power and the introduction of these policies to appease Singaporeans. 

Now, imagine a world where PAP had 80% of the mandate in GE2011. Meaning there're no feedbacks on the terrible job they're doing and no fear of losing power. Today, every other HDB resale transaction would be a million dollars, our population would be more than 6 million with 50% foreigners and even more elderlies would be on the streets scrapping for cardboards. These are all very real possibilities in that world.

It’s also interesting to see how GE2011 is the only time the government publicly admitted their mistakes and apologised for it. ""If we didn't get it right, I'm sorry. But we will try better the next time”, these words by LHL were printed in 4 languages across all forms of state media just 3 days before polling day in GE2011. Why did he say it? Because he genuinely felt so? Probably not. Those words were not said out of concern but out of fear. The fear of losing power. So if you want to see more instances of PAP eating their humble pie, vote for opposition. 

If you're keen on alleviating elderly poverty, improving social mobility, maintaining our current population size and having more policies aimed at helping average Singaporeans, voting for opposition parties is also a great way to do it. Opposition parties don’t even have to get into parliament for these things to happen. As long as the PAP is in constant fear of losing power, every decision they make in the next 5 years will be like walking on egg shells. That way, they'll automatically start caring more about the people. Conversely, if PAP is given too much power, they will start introducing policies that are hard to swallow and tell Singaporeans to ‘bite the bullet’ again.

Similarly, on the topic of power, ask yourself, why did the PAP call for an election during the COVID-19 pandemic when they know that campaigning will no doubt increase the likelihood of community spread? Is this the right thing to do for a government that cares about its people? Or was it a politically motivated move right after giving out 90 billion dollars in packages from our reserves and seeing it as an opportune moment to make use of the fear of COVID-19 to garner votes. Ask yourself, what made the government issue out 17 POFMA notices to political opponents in the past 5 days. Are all those notices truly in the interest of Singapore or was it just an election manoeuvre to discredit political opponents? Ask yourself, was the amendment of the constitution just before PE2017 a move to benefit Singapore, or was it just to elect someone within the party so they could entrench themselves with even more power? 

The PAP is a reasonably competent government and I dare say 70% of their members(definitely not all) wants the best for Singapore. Opposition is currently not ready to form the government and PAP should continue to be so. Having said that, after being in power for more than 50 years, it’s inevitable for them to lose focus and sway their interest from servicing Singaporeans to keeping their inner circle of friends and families(I don’t even want to go into how bad cronyism is in our GLCs and Stat boards) powerful in perpetuity. If you want them to keep their focus on the former and not the latter, it’s VERY important that we DO NOT give them the overwhelming mandate that they are looking for this coming Friday. If their popular vote exceeds 75% this GE, you’ll can surely expect more arrogance from them for the next 5 years.

Please vote wisely.

If you found this compelling, please considering sharing it with any of your friends and family that might be swing voters. The ground is very very very sweet for PAP now, I wouldn’t be surprised if they manage to secure all 93 seats with more than 75% of popular votes come Friday. Thank you for reading.

tl;dr: Want the government to be more accountable for their actions and decisions? Don’t give them the overwhelming mandate they are looking for. Make them fear that they could lose power anytime. That’s the only way to guarantee they will work harder and do better for Singapore and Singaporeans.",,PAP's greatest fear and why you should vote for opposition(even if the ones in your area are hopeless),https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hmn6qy/paps_greatest_fear_and_why_you_should_vote_for/

hwl2do,1595528870,hwl2do,532,,"I write this from a point of fear and exasperation. My life at home revolves around avoiding and fearing my dad. But in the last year or so he has gained a new habit that scares and triggers me. 

Every night (and every morning + afternoon since WFH started), he plays a series of videos about China. They are usually either videos with robot voices, or videos with a human talking angrily. 

The views and content I've heard from these videos include: 
- China is a lion, that is only sleeping right now
- The islands in the South China sea are China's, because China got them first in a past dynasty. All other countries opposing China are flawed, barbaric, have violent histories, etc. and they should be ashamed; or they used to be under the barbaric rule of the west, and so should side with China instead 
- Back when the Hong Kong courts overturned the mask ban last year, one video said about the judges involved: ""Foreigners are not Chinese, they don't have Chinese blood, that's why they don't care about China""
- If I don't pay attention, all I hear is 中国的 (China's) and 美国的 (America's) on loop

All this began when our Chinese TV channels started showing mainly shows from China, and removed most shows from Taiwan. He got interested in watching those shows online, and got steadily into angrier-sounding videos via recommendations. Now every day and night I'm bombarded with anti-US videos with strident robotic voices, and my dad has been making increasingly extreme and hostile comments, like: 
- Spouting conspiracy theories about SARS and COVID being a western weapon targeting Asian races, and when Germans first got infected he said ""cannot be leh""
- Using ""angmoh"" as an actual slur against any European/Australian/American white people
- Gloating that more angmohs are dying from COVID, meaning they are inferior to the Chinese
- Joking about invading the US because they seem weak right now).  


My mum is gradually being influenced too (she also gloated about the COVID deaths). I'm a major pacifist so all this makes me struggle to live peacefully at home. 

I think that this behaviour is self-radicalisation, no less harmful than the kind promoting ISIS/terrorism that got people in trouble with ISA. Has anyone else observed those around them getting similarly radicalised? And does anyone know what I can do about it? I have been frantically searching for a suitable de-radicalisation video/article to drop into the family group chat, but most content I find discussing biased or rage-inducing media is US/UK-centric. Any suggestions would be appreciated! 

Note: In case it's not obvious, I am neither pro- nor anti- China.  

Second note: Can y'all don't downvote unless it's really irrelevant? I'm not looking for an echo chamber. I'm willing to hear the other side as long as they're not ads or trolls.

Yet a lot of expats and foreigners are worried about their employability in Singapore post-circuit breaker. I see a lot of posts and comments on people saying they got a job in Singapore before covid but it’s now on hold, or that they want their passes to be approved so they can work here.

I’m not against foreign talent employment, but I want everyone to be pragmatic and practical. So many singaporeans have been laid off, so why would the government hire a glut of foreigners when their own citizens are now jobless? Post covid recovery will probably see an increase in local hiring and lower foreign employment. I wouldn’t be surprised if the government put either sanctions to reduce foreign hiring, or put carrots in place to encourage local hiring.

Let’s be real. Singaporeans live in Singapore. Most of us don’t have the means to leave Singapore to find jobs elsewhere. Foreigners and expats (higher level education) who come to Singapore are mainly for the “fun and excitement” of living in Singapore. You foreigners do not NEED to find a job in Singapore. It’s a want, not a need. On the other hand, Singaporean MUST find a job in Singapore cuz some of us have no choice. It’s not like trump USA is going to accept foreign work visas when Americans are going jobless. There is protectionism in the EU. My needs as a Singaporean should definitely come before the wants of a foreigner in this period (Singapore may be fun for you to live in and brag about, but Singapore is a home that I can’t exactly ditch and run from).

And when Singaporean locals have PhD and bachelors and masters, why should they hire a foreign talent for the same position? Gotta be realistic. In a recession, the government needs to prioritize its own citizens before foreigners, or they’ll face disgruntlement in the populace.

On one hand, we find it outrageous when one of us is attacked or bullied over in Australia and London. Yet, when you look at the situation locally, our behaviour is no better. 

Sure, we don’t express our racism by means of force or violence but the way we treat foreign workers are inexcusable. When Covid started, there were implicit acts of racism towards Mainland Chinese. 

With the dormitory situation now, we have Singaporeans talking down to these workers. Especially in the video where a Chinese dude approached a pitiful Indian man (I’m guessing construction worker) walking about without his mask. Yes, it’s illegal and it’s alright to approach him to ask him to put on his mask. But, couldn’t the guy have done it better? There was no need to scream at the man or degrade him with phrases like “are you educated” etc. 

Furthermore, the Indian man was passive the entire time and even started addressing the perpetrator as ‘Sir’.
